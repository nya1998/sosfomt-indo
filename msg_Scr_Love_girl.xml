Yep. We've got a lot of eggs again today. That's a good
sign that our chickens are all happy and healthy.<wait><page>
I soft-boiled a few of them to munch on while I was
working. Want one, Mom?<wait>

My, my! Thank you so much, Rick. Soft-boiled eggs make
such a yummy snack.<wait>

Are you a traveler here to scope out our local sights

someone would be moving into that farm. I guess that's

Glad to hear you think so! Hang on a sec...<wait>

Here. Our chickens laid a ton of eggs, so I soft-boiled some
of them and ended up with a few too many to eat.<wait><page>
I don't want them to go to waste, so I figured I'd give
them to a fellow egg lover. If you want, that is.<wait>

Good luck with everything on the farm.<wait>

Ah. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, everyone has different

Oh, and good luck with your farm work. If there's
anything I can do to help, just let me know.<wait>

pop 'em in hot water. But if you don't like them, oh well.<wait>

you see.<wait>

Our eggs are especially flavorful, though...<wait>

That plot is awfully big. It's rather impressive

It's this wristwatch. Dad gave it to me a long time ago.<wait>

But then he went off on a hunt for some flower that can
supposedly cure Mom's illness. He's been gone ever since.<wait><page>
What's he doing? When'll he be back? We don't know,
because we haven't heard a word from him. I know Mom
misses him.<wait>

[0089]
Oh... Geez, I'm sorry. This watch dredged up some old
memories and I got wrapped up in thinking about Dad.<wait><page>
I'm boring you, I know.<wait>

Yeaaah, it's kind of a buzzkill...

I'm okay with you just calling me "Rick," like always.<wait><page>
But what do you want me to call YOU?<wait>

My <nickname>! ∀ Well? Do you like the ring of it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0187]
You want me to call you something else? Sure. Like what?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0188]
Gotcha. From now on, I'll call you <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0189]
Okay. <nickname>, even though we're married now,
I still plan to work at the family chicken farm, like
always.<wait><page>
I'll spend mornings and evenings here, though.
Are you okay with that?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0190]
Yep, that's fine.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0191]
No! Don't leave me!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0192]
Thanks, <nickname>. I knew you'd understand.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0193]
I wish I didn't have to, but I'm the only one who can look
after our chickens properly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0194]
So, um...yeah. ∀ I'm really looking forward to spending my
life with you, <nickname>.<wait>

[0198]
Hm? Haven't seen you around before. Lemme guess:
you're the new gal who just moved into that old
farmhouse?<wait><page>
<playername>, eh? Hi! I'm Kai. I run the Beach Cafe
here. Good to meetcha!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0199]
Hm? Haven't seen you around before. Lemme guess:
you're the new guy who just moved into that old
farmhouse?<wait><page>
<playername>, eh? Hi! I'm Kai. I run the Beach Cafe
here. Good to meetcha!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0200]
Yo, <playername>! It's a real scorcher out there
today, eh? How you holdin' up? Me?
Just doin' a little cleaning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0201]
Hey, uh, Mr. Thomas mentioned something to me a while
back and it got me wonderin'.<wait><page>
Is it true that you split from your family and are living
here on your own?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0202]
Huh. So you are, then. Oh, I don't mean any offense
by that. Honest.<wait><page>
I was just kinda surprised, y'know? One gal running a
whole farm all by her lonesome... That's awesome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0203]
Huh. So you are, then. Oh, I don't mean any offense
by that. Honest.<wait><page>
I was just kinda surprised, y'know? One guy running a
whole farm all by his lonesome... That's awesome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0204]
See, I've already moved outta my family's place too.
Do you think that's...I dunno, selfish of me? Be honest.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0205]
Incorrigible! I can't believe you!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0206]
Those who live in glass farmhouses...
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0207]
You can't, huh...<wait><page>
I've got my reasons, y'know. Just like I'm sure you've got
yours, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0208]
Though I guess I CAN understand how some people would
see it as me bein' selfish and abandoning my parents or
something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0209]
Anyway, I'd better get back to cleanin'. Come on by my
Cafe if you ever have time. I'd love to see ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0210]
Ah. So you're cool with it, huh? I'm glad you're not as
uptight as some people are when I bring this up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0211]
See, me and my folks're like oil and water. It's not that
we hate each other. Our lifestyles just don't mesh,
y'know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0212]
We should really sit down and shoot the breeze when
we've both got time. I bet we've got a lot in common.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0213]
Welcome!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0214]
Yo, <playername>! How's life on the farm? You tillin'
soil, plantin' seeds, all that good stuff?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0215]
Really? Cool! Glad to hear things are going well for you.<wait><page>
It's weird. Knowing you're out there workin' hard gives
ME the energy to work hard too. Ha ha! Just kidding.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0216]
So! You here for a bite to eat? Or are you just killin'
time?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0217]
Hm? Your schedule opened up, so you came to hang out
and chat?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0218]
Haha, awesome! As you can see, it's not like I have any
other customers, so a solid conversation sounds great
to me.<wait><page>
Come to think of it, I don't think I've asked what you
grow on your farm. What kinda crops do you have going?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0219]
Pink Cats and stuff.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0220]
Tons of Pineapples.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0221]
I have something of a black thumb...
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0222]
Pink Cats, huh? Those are flowers, right?
They sure are pretty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0223]
See, I love everything summer, so if you're raising any
summer crops, I sure wouldn't say no to you bringing
me some.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0224]
Dude, really? No way! Pineapple is one of my most
favorite foods ever!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0225]
If you end up growing a good crop, I'd seriously love you
forever if you shared some with me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0226]
Dude, really?! O-Oh, uh... Promise you
won't laugh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0227]
See, pineapple is actually one of my
most favorite foods ever.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0228]
Thanks! ♪ To be honest, it's kinda embarrassing to admit.
I mean, folks tend to have...strong opinions on pineapple.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0229]
I'm not asking you to give 'em to me for free, though.
Promise. If you hook me up, I'll hook YOU up in return.
Deal?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0230]
I'll bend over backwards to help a bud who literally feeds
my pineapple addiction. Trust and believe.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0231]
Uh, seriously? Nothing? Like, nada? Zip? Zilch? ...Oh, wait.
I get it. You only do livestock, then. Gotcha.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0232]
Hey, it's your farm. You can do whatever you want
with it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0233]
Huh. So you aren't raising any crops, then. That's too bad.
Kind of a waste, if ya ask me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0234]
Huh. So you aren't raising any of those then, eh? Ah, well.
They DO take a lot of time and effort, after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0235]
I love everything to do with summer, but pineapples?
Oh, man. Let's just say they have a special place
in my heart.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0236]
If you're ever interested, why not try your hand at
growing some crops? Could be fun! You never know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0237]
Yo, <playername>! Whassup?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0238]
Huh? Whoa! Dude, are you okay?! Hang in there!
I'll getcha to the Clinic right away! C'mon!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0239]
Let's get you to the Clinic. C'mon!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0240]
The patient is sleeping now. All symptoms have subsided,
so there is nothing to worry about. Well, for now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0241]
Really? Thanks a million, Doctor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0242]
Eesh! Gave me a heart attack, that's for sure.
<playername> is usually healthy as a horse, but they
came tottering in...<wait><page>
...Then faceplanted right in front of me. I was terrified
they'd caught the plague or something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0243]
I must admit, I was awfully surprised by the ferocious
look on your face when you stormed in here with
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0244]
Ah, yeah... Sorry about that. Didn't mean to make a fuss.
I was just totally focused on getting <playername>
here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0245]
Yes. I know you meant nothing by it. You were simply
worried for <playername>'s health.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0246]
Well, uh...yeah. I mean, <playername> IS a valuable
member of our community, y'know? Who WOULDN'T
have freaked out?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0247]
Everyone, <playername> has regained consciousness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0248]
Really? That's good to hear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0249]
Everyone, <playername> is awake now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0250]
<playername>, how do you feel? Are you nauseated
at all? Does your head hurt?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0251]
I see. As I suspected, you collapsed from mild heatstroke.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0252]
The weather is particularly hot today. I think your farm
chores may have tired you out more than you realized.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0253]
Heatstroke, eh? Never had it myself, knock on wood, but
you definitely need to watch out for it on days like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0254]
<playername>, I strongly recommend that you get
plenty of fluids throughout the day. Maintain a healthy
diet, too.<wait><page>
If you still feel lightheaded, you may stay here and rest
as long as you need.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0255]
Good. You don't look like death warmed over anymore.
That's a load off my mind, I'll tell you what.<wait><page>
Oh, but you should still get some rest.
No pushing yourself, got it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0256]
Okay, if you insist.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0257]
Farming waits for no woman!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0258]
Okay, if you insist.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0259]
Farming waits for no man!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0260]
I DO insist. You need it. I mean, when it's time to put your
nose to the grindstone, you really go all-out.<wait><page>
That's why when it's time to rest, you ought to kick back
and rest like no one's ever rested before. 'Kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0261]
Oh yeah! Almost forgot. Here. This is... Well, it's a little
charm I got when I was traveling. You can have it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0262]
I know running a farm can't be easy, but don't push
yourself too hard. Capisce?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0263]
All right, then. I'd better go. You be sure to rest until
you're at 110%, y'hear? Don't make me come check
on you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0264]
*sigh* Listen, do you even remember collapsing? You
faceplanted. Right on the beach. It was ROUGH, dude.<wait><page>
If I hadn't come out when I did, you would've gotten baked
crispier than a tater tot under that hot sun.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0265]
I know you're a hard worker who's serious about your
job, but you're gonna work yourself sick at this rate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0266]
Don't push yourself so hard all the time. It worries me
when you do that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0267]
I mean, I guess you know your own limits better
than anyone. If you say you're fine, I'm not gonna
fight you on it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0268]
Farm work is no joke, I know. Be careful and take care of
yourself, 'kay? For me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0269]
Hey, <playername>! Over here!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0270]
Yo, <playername>! Sorry, but the Cafe is closed
right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0271]
Nah, I'm not sick or anything. Just thought I'd take a
chance to mull over some stuff that's been on my mind.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0272]
Don't worry, it's nothin' big. Anyway, why don't you take
a break and come watch the sea with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0273]
Maaan, nothin' really beats the smell of salt in your
nostrils and the sound of the ocean waves, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0274]
Sometimes, I wish I could just sit here, turn my brain off,
and gaze out across the water forever...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0275]
Hm? Is something bothering me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0276]
Ah. Sorry. I was trying not to worry you, but I guess I'm
not great at hiding when somethin' is eatin' at me, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0277]
Ugh. Heck with it. Stewing in it all by myself isn't getting
me anywhere, so I might as well ask you, if you'll listen.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0278]
This'll probably seem like a dumb thing to be so worried
over, but it's been bugging me, okay?<wait><page>
See, I know I talk all casual like this with everybody,
but apparently, some of the folks around here think
that's rude.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0279]
Can't say I have the faintest clue what's wrong with it.
But it seems like it really rubs some folks the wrong way.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0280]
Not that I particularly care what other people think of
me. I haven't ever felt the need to change myself to suit
them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0281]
But lately I've been wonderin' if I need to do
SOMETHING, if only to head off the weird ideas people
get about me.<wait><page>
What do YOU think, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0282]
Don't let it bother you.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0283]
A different approach couldn't hurt.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0284]
Don't change yourself for anyone.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0285]
It's worth meeting them halfway.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0286]
Don't let it bother me, eh? Y'know, it makes me feel
a whole lot better knowing you've got my back,
<playername>.<wait><page>
Yeah...you're right! There's nothing I need to get
so worked up over, is there? Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0287]
The best thing I can do is to be true to myself. Changing
just to please others will make me miserable, no doubt.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0288]
Don't change myself for them? Y'know, it makes me feel
a whole lot better knowing you've got my back,
<playername>.<wait><page>
Yeah...you're right! There's nothing I need to get
so worked up over, is there? Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0289]
Huh... So I take it you agree with the others? You think
the way I'm casual with folks is actually kinda rude?<wait><page>
...Okay. I don't know how successful I'll be, but I'll see
what I can do to change things for the better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0290]
What, you think the way I talk is rude, too? Yikes... Gotta
say, I'm pretty shocked. Didn't expect that from you.<wait><page>
...Okay. I don't know how successful I'll be, but I'll see
what I can do to change things for the better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0291]
Thanks for listening, <playername>. I'm glad I talked
to you about this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0292]
*sigh* Changing up how I talk to be more formal-like, eh?
That's gonna be tough.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0293]
Okay, here oughta give us some privacy.
So...could you run that by me again?<wait><page>
And, uh... This isn't some kind of prank, is it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0294]
I know you're not that sorta person, but this is all so
sudden, y'know? It's kinda hard to swallow outta
nowhere.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0295]
Haha... So it sounds like we've both been thinkin'
the same thing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0296]
Since we've been boyfriend and girlfriend, having you
around has just felt more and more natural, y'know?<wait><page>
I was startin' to hope that maybe things could go on like
this forever...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0297]

[0299]
Heck YEAH, my answer's yes! I love you and wanna

Man, if this is a dream, I don't ever wanna wake up!
We're gonna kill it at this whole marriage thing,
<playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0301]
Anyways, I'm gonna head back to the Cafe. I'll let the
mayor know, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0302]
So I guess the next thing to do is go and spread the word.
I'd like a ceremony, and a party for everyone, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0303]
Ah, you are getting married? Wonderful!
Congratulations to you both!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Mr. Thomas really went all-out, too. I was like,
"Seriously? You got all this stuff together just for us?"<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Still... It's about time I got to have a minute alone with my
special gal.<wait>

Anyway, now that we're married and all, what do you say
to giving each other new nicknames? Wouldn't that be
cool?<wait><page>
You can just keep calling me "Kai," like always.<wait><page>
But what do you want ME to call YOU?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0326]
Gotcha! That settles that, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0327]
Gotcha! That settles that, then.
<nickname> it is. ∀<wait>

Something else? Like what?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0329]
Gotcha! I'll call you <nickname>
from now on, 'kay? ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0330]
Oh, yeah! Almost forgot. With us being married and all,
I think I'll set down roots here in Mineral Town.<wait><page>
Mind if I commute from here to my Beach Cafe
every day?<wait><page>
Though...thinkin' about it, it'll be funny to have a summer
Cafe open all year round, won't it? Ah, well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0331]
Thanks, <nickname>. I appreciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0332]
Hey, c'mon. That's too tall an order. I'll be here with you

a moment of your time?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0336]
You're <playername>, the one who moved onto that
farm, correct?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0337]
I'm Carter, the priest at this humble Church.
It's a pleasure to meet you.<wait>

[0345]
My request concerns him, actually. Would you mind
striking up a conversation with him? Any topic will do,
I'm sure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0346]
The poor lamb came to this town all alone, just like
you did, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0347]
But he has a hard time communicating with anyone
other than me, it seems.<wait><page>
He plainly struggles in the realm of conversation,
the poor boy--particularly when it comes to speaking
up first.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0348]
The poor lamb came to this town all alone, just like
you did, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0349]
Oh, you'll do it? Bless you, child.
I wish you the best of luck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0350]
Oh... Hey...
Um, do you need something from me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0351]
You're...<playername>?
I'm...Cliff.
Uh... Nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0352]
You're...<playername>?
I'm...Cliff.
Uh... Nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0353]
<playername>...
Uh... H-Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0354]
<playername>...
Uh... H-Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0355]
.........
.........Uh.<wait><page>
Wh-What is it? Is there...something on my face?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0356]
Huh? You want...to talk?
With me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0357]
Oh... Um, w-well, I...
U-Uh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0358]
I get so nervous, especially when I'm alone with someone.
I, uh, can't talk very well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0359]
Pull yourself together, man!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0360]
Take your time.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0361]
Pull yourself together, man!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0362]
Take your time.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0363]
Right... I'd, uh, like to, but...
It's...easier said than done, you know?<wait><page>
So, um, I'm sorry, but...
I'd like to be alone. P-Please.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0364]
...Yeah, I think I've calmed down now. Thank you,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0365]
...Yeah, I think I've calmed down now. Thank you,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0366]
I shouldn't worry about it? G-Gotcha. You're nice,
<playername>.<wait><page>
Speaking of which...you came to this town alone and are
running a farm all by yourself, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0367]
Incredible. I can't even imagine myself raising crops
or animals.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0368]
It might be weird for me to say, but, uh, I'm sure it's
really hard, so...hang in there, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0369]
I shouldn't worry about it? G-Gotcha. You're nice,
<playername>.<wait><page>
Speaking of which...you came to this town alone and are
running a farm all by yourself, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0370]
And, uh... Not to be a bother, but would you mind talking
with me again sometime? O-Only if you get a chance,
that is.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0371]
I'm, uh, really bad at talking with people, but if it's you,
<playername>...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0372]
I'm, uh, really bad at talking with people, but if it's you,
<playername>...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0373]
Ahem. Well, be careful on your way home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0374]
Oh, if it isn't <playername>.
Perfect timing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0375]
Oh, if it isn't <playername>.
Perfect timing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0376]
Cliff and I were just making plans to have supper
together here today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0377]
If you don't have dinner plans, would you...like to join us,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0378]
If you don't have dinner plans, would you...like to join us,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0379]
It'd be nice to eat together with you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0380]
It'd be nice to eat together with you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0381]
We're planning on having Ran bring food from the Inn.<wait><page>
Would you two mind helping to clean up before she
arrives?<wait><page>
I'll be in the Confessional, so if anyone comes, let me know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0382]
Ugh, Carter... You don't have to clean, <playername>.
I'll take care of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0383]
Ugh, Carter... You don't have to clean, <playername>.
I'll take care of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0384]
Good, because I was about to say...
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0385]
I'd like to help.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0386]
Then I'll kick back while you clean.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0387]
It'll be good exercise.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0388]
Then, uh... Just wait outside until I'm done, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0389]
Whoa! You almost scared the broom bristles off of me!
...Wait, is that you, <playername>?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0390]
Sorry, I was barreling along and didn't expect anyone
to be in front of the Church.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0391]
Whoa! You almost scared the broom bristles off of me!
...Wait, is that you, <playername>?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0392]
Oh...he invited you over, huh? So THAT'S why you were
out here. Haha. Sorry to keep you waiting for dinner.<wait><page>
I didn't realize you and Cliff were that close, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0393]
I mean, Cliff basically only talks to Carter, you know?
He's the quintessential keeps-to-himself type.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0394]
That's why I've been a little worried about him.
But I guess I didn't need to be, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0395]
Oh...he invited you over, huh? So THAT'S why you were
out here. Haha. Sorry to keep you waiting for dinner.<wait><page>
I didn't realize you and Cliff were that close, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0396]
Well, let's head in before the food gets cold.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0397]
Oh, Ran. I see you've brought our food.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0398]
Cliff just finished cleaning, too. You have most excellent
timing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0399]
Thanks for bringing it, Ran.
And...sorry for the wait, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0400]
Now, let's dig in while it's still hot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0401]
Thanks for bringing it, Ran.
And...sorry for the wait, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0402]
It was nice eating together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0403]
Y-Yeah? That's awfully nice of you. Then if you wouldn't
mind lending a hand with this...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0404]
You'll help just for the exercise? Hahaha. Okay, then.
I'd be glad to take you up on that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0405]
Oh...sorry for staring. I was just thinking that, um...
You're really skilled with your hands.<wait><page>
And I couldn't help wondering...if you work this quickly
on the farm, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0406]
Oh...sorry for staring. I was just thinking that, um...
You're really skilled with your hands.<wait><page>
And I couldn't help wondering...if you work this quickly
on the farm, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0407]
Tending to the fields and animals...
Rushing to town, then to the forest...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0408]
Hahaha, I guess doing that every day really WOULD
teach you how to make the most of your time in a hurry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0409]
Evening! Delivery! Whooo's hungry?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0410]
Well, the food's here, so let's put the cleaning on pause
for now. I'll go get Carter.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0411]
Oh... Hello, Duke.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0412]
Good job today, Cliff. Your work ethic never fails to
impress. Don't hesitate to take a breather if you need it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0413]
No need to worry... I'm fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0414]
Manna is one step ahead of you, I'm afraid--she's
concerned you might collapse from overwork.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0415]
What? No, I'm fine, really, so... Please don't work
yourselves up over me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0416]
"Don't work ourselves up"?
Now see here, Cliff...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0417]
Well, if it isn't <playername>.
Don't just stand over there. Come here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0418]
You're right on cue. Cliff, why don't you mosey on over to
Mother's Hill with <playername>?<wait><page>
With the beautiful weather we're having today, I'm sure
there'll be a great view from the peak.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0419]
What? But I still have work to--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0420]
Let me stop you right there. You've already done your
fair share of work for today. I'll finish up the rest.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0421]
But...I can't let you do that. I took on this job, so I have to
see it to--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0422]
Cliff. If I recall correctly...<wait><page>
...you haven't properly thanked <playername> for
helping you land this job in the first place.<wait><page>
Listen to me when I say to take advantage of this
opportunity. Please humor me on this, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0423]
...Okay, you win. I'll go.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0424]
Oh, <playername>, look.
A rabbit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0425]
It's so nice to see one up close.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0426]
Oh, <playername>, look.
A rabbit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0427]
Oh... It ran away. That's too bad. I wanted to watch
it a while longer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0428]
We're finally here.
Are you okay, <playername>?
Um, you're not tired, are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0429]
We're finally here.
Are you okay, <playername>?
Um, you're not tired, are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0430]
What's that? Working on the farm has toughened you up
enough to make this a cakewalk? Well, that's good to
hear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0431]
That Duke... Well, he can be a little bossy at times, so...<wait><page>
I was worried that I'd dragged you into this and ruined
your day, or something...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0432]
That Duke... Well, he can be a little bossy at times, so...<wait><page>
I was worried that I'd dragged you into this and ruined
your day, or something...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0433]
But I guess it's not so bad that he gave me an extra push.
It's true that I haven't thanked you yet, after all.<wait><page>
<playername>...
Thank you. Seriously.<wait><page>
It's because of you that I've started to envision
something of a life for myself here in this town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0434]
But I guess it's not so bad that he gave me an extra push.

something of a life for myself here in this town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0435]
Little by little, I've started getting used to this job.
Heck, I think I'm even enjoying it at this point.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0436]
Yeah...
Hey, uh, <playername>...
Do you...like the work you do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0437]
Yeah...
Hey, uh, <playername>...
Do you...like the work you do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0438]
Yo hoe, a farmer's life for me!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0439]
I've never thought about it.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0440]
I think it's my calling.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0441]
My opinion is still germinating.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0442]
Th-That satisfying, huh? I think I've come to like my work,
too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0443]
The fruit I pick gets turned into wine that so many
people end up enjoying. Just thinking about it is so...<wait><page>
I've never felt this way before. When I make that
connection, it's like...like my effort actually means
something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0444]
I'm still not very good at it, though. I'm sure I've given
Duke and Manna my fair share of headaches from
messing up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0445]
Um, I know this is sudden, but...here. I made this
to thank you for everything. You're welcome to
have it, if you want.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0446]
W-Well, I guess I'll head back.
I'm worried about Duke.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0447]
O-Oh... I guess that was a bad question. Sorry for asking...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0448]
W-Well, I guess I'll head back.
I'm worried about Duke.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0449]
...Wonder what...is thinking?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0450]
Well, it's...problem. So you need to stay out of it, dear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0451]
But...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0452]
Aren't you worried about Cliff?
You just saw, didn't you? He...
...And then...so...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0453]
I know. I can't say I'm not worried.
Cliff...and... It's such a shock.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0454]
That's exactly why we need to confront him about it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0455]
I told you!
It's between them!<wait><page>
I'm concerned about Cliff myself, trust me.<wait><page>
But I'd rather wait and see than stick my nose where it
doesn't belong and only succeed in making things worse!<wait><page>
Even if you asked him about it, what advice could YOU
possibly give?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0456]
O-Oh! Hey!
Fancy seeing you here, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0457]
Hello, <playername>.
You didn't happen to overhear what we were just talking
about, did you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0458]
...You couldn't hear what we were saying? Well, I assure
you we weren't fighting.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0459]
We're just of two minds on something--typical for a
married couple, I assure you. Sorry if we made you
uncomfortable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0460]
<playername>, may I ask you something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0461]
Good grief, dear! Just drop it. Can't you for ONE second
realize when you're overstepping your boundaries?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0462]
Oh, shut your trap! What's wrong with being worried
about your own family?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0463]
*sigh* I'm done.
Do whatever you want.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0464]
I'm so sorry, <playername>.
To be honest...it's about Cliff.<wait><page>
What would you say is his weakness?
I know it's out of the blue, but what's the first thing that
comes to mind?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0465]
He overthinks things.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0466]
Cliff? No weaknesses detected.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0467]
Exactly! You know him so well, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0468]
I can't argue that, dear. He's bottled up and corked
tighter than our finest vintage.<wait><page>
We'd love it if he'd confide in us, but it's impossible to
coax anything out of him. It's frustrating.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0469]
No, no. It's great to celebrate a person's strengths, but
you have to be aware of their weaknesses, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0470]
Actually, sorry. This is between us.
So don't worry about it, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0471]
Duke. Manna.
I've finished my work for today.<wait><page>
Oh, hello, <playername>.
You have business at the store?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0472]
Duke. Manna.
I've finished my work for today.<wait><page>
Oh, hello, <playername>.
You have business at the store?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0473]
H-Hey! Good job, Cliff.
Thanks for putting in 110%, as always.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0474]
<playername> was JUST talking about having supper
with you at the Inn today. Weren't you,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0475]
Huh? Y-You came all the way here for that?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0476]
That's right, Cliff.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0477]
You've finished your work, so scoot! We'll handle it from
here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0478]
Yes, sir. Thank you. Well, <playername>, should we
get going?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0479]
Yes, sir. Thank you. Well, <playername>, should we
get going?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0480]
Today's special really hit the spot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0481]
I mean, it's always really good, but...
Today was on another level. I wonder why.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0482]
Is it because I'm with you, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0483]
It's gotta be...
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0484]
Hey...<playername>.
There's something I want to ask you.
Do you mind?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0485]
Is it because I'm with you, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0486]
Hey...<playername>.
There's something I want to ask you.
Do you mind?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0487]
Back at work, before I came in to report that I was done,
you three were talking about something, right?<wait><page>
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I did
overhear bits and pieces...<wait><page>
I only heard my name, really...and then I noticed that Duke
and Manna were acting odd.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0488]
Could it be that I...caused trouble for them again without
even realizing it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0489]
They're worried about you.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0490]
You're important to them.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0491]
Worried... Yeah, I can see why...
I still have a lot to learn, so I'm sure they feel like they
can't rely on me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0492]
Thank you for telling me. I'll be sure to work extra hard
from now on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0493]
I'm...important to them? Huh? We're not even family,
so why would they...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0494]
But if that's true... I'm so happy that I'm at a loss for
words. I don't feel like I deserve it, honestly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0495]
Thank you so much for today, <playername>. Being
with you stirs something in me that I can't explain.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0496]
I...hope you'll invite me out again sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0497]
Thank you so much for today, <playername>.
I had a lot of fun.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0498]
Does Cliff really think that...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0499]
Just look at what you've wrought.
Your impulsiveness has made everything awkward.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0500]
Yeah... I thought setting them up was a good idea,
but I guess I jumped the gun.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0501]
Excuse us, <playername>.
It seems we were mistaken.
Please don't worry about it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0502]
Well, no matter what sort of feelings you harbor
for Cliff, it doesn't change the fact that you two get
along well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0503]
I leave Ran to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0504]
What is it? You here for some food?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0505]
Phew... I think we'll be fine here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0506]
So...about what you brought up earlier...
U-Uh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0507]
I'm not...misunderstanding, right?
If you're serious, could you show that to me once more?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0508]
It's true. It's really true... It's almost hard to believe, but
the evidence stands before my eyes. I'm so happy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0509]
Meeting you changed my life forever. You were the first
person to ever quiet the voice of my inner saboteur.<wait><page>
I couldn't stop thinking about you. About the woman
who made me want to stay in this town forever.
And here we are.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

"Am I good enough for her?" I can't help but wonder.
But if you'll have me, I'd be honored to be
your husband.<wait>

To have my dreams become reality so suddenly...
Do I even deserve to be this happy?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0514]
Hey, <playername>. I'd like to tell Duke and Manna...
And Carter, too.<wait><page>
It shouldn't take long.<wait>

Cliff... I'm so happy for you.
I was waiting for this day to come.
Congratulations.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0517]
What? Are you crying, dear? You should be marking this
occasion with congratulations, not tears!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0518]
But it's just that Cliff--Cliff, of all people--has finally
found happiness. I can't help but feel emotional.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0519]
My, my. Congratulations, Cliff.
I'm glad to see you have people who care so deeply
about you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0520]
Yeah...
Duke...and Manna...
And you too, Carter.<wait><page>
Thank you so much for always thinking of me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0521]
<playername>, I leave Cliff in your capable hands.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0522]

Well, we'd better start preparing for the wedding
ceremony, then. It's about to get busy around here!<wait>

[0525]
We need to prepare the venue and contact
the townspeople, so it'll be about a week.
Leave everything to me, Cliff!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0526]
I can't tell you how much that means to me, Duke...
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0527]
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
<playername> and Cliff joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0528]
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
<playername> and Cliff joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0529]
<playername>. Cliff. Do you both hereby swear
to take each other as your sole partner for the
rest of your lives...<wait><page>
...To have and to hold, to respect and to cherish,
your hearts united no matter what may come?
For now, and forever?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0530]
Cliff, just so you know, you're like a son to me!
I won't accept anything less than you living
happily ever after!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0531]
Cliff! <playername>! Congratulations!
I wish you two nothing but happiness!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0532]
Cliff, from now on, the two of you will be sharing
one another's burdens and blessings alike.
I wish you all the best.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0533]
<playername>, I hope you'll stay with me forever.
I-I...I love you. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0534]
<playername>, I hope you'll stay with me forever.
I-I...I love you. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0535]
Phew. I'm exhausted. After the ceremony was pictures,
and then there was the reception and everything else...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0536]
Phew. I'm exhausted. After the ceremony was pictures,
and then there was the reception and everything else...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0537]
Duke and the others really went to town getting
everything ready.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0538]
But...now we're finally alone. A-And for the first time as
husband and wife, no less.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0539]
But...now we're finally alone. A-And for the first time as
husbands, no less.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0540]
Now that we're married, should we, um, call each other
something different?<wait><page>
I'm fine with you continuing to call me "Cliff."<wait><page>
But what should I call you, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0541]
Yeah. Okay.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0542]
Okay, then... Love. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0543]
Okay, then... Honey. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0544]
Another nickname?
Like what, for instance?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0545]
Okay. I'll call you <nickname> from now on. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0546]
About our new life together, <nickname>...<wait><page>
I plan to live here, of course, but would you mind if I kept
working at the Vineyard?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0547]
Thanks, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0548]
Sorry. It's just that I finally found a job, so I don't want
to quit it.<wait><page>
I promise I'll be home in the mornings and evenings, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0549]
So, um, yeah, <nickname>. ∀
Here's to our new life together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0550]
So, um, yeah, <nickname>. ∀
Here's to our new life together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0551]
Why?! Tell me what's wrong with it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0552]
TELL you? Fool! Look within. You already have the
answer. If you can't even understand that...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0553]
What? What're you looking at? If you don't have any
business here, then...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0554]
Gray! How dare you address a customer in such
an impertinent manner!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0555]
Oh... S-Sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0556]
Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0557]
Ah, so you're <playername>. You're the one who
recently took over that farm.<wait><page>
My name is Saibara.
This boy here's my grandson, Gray.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0558]
...Yup. Nice to meetcha.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0559]
Oh, if it isn't <playername>.<wait><page>
Perfect timing. This boy here's my grandson, Gray.<wait><page>
Come now, Gray. Say hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0560]
Oh...it's you, <playername>.
...Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0561]
What, you know each other?<wait><page>
Ah, could you be <playername>?
The one who took over that farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0562]
I see. My name is Saibara.
I work here as a blacksmith.<wait><page>
Now, then...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0563]
Oh...it's you, <playername>.
...Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0564]
<playername>, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0565]
I'm going to take a break.
You deal with our customer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0566]
Sorry 'bout earlier.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0567]
*sigh* You shouldn't have had to walk into that. As you no
doubt heard, he was telling me to redo my work.<wait><page>
I hafta fight for so much as a scrap of encouragement or
praise from Grandpa.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0568]
It's like this every day.<wait><page>
Like, to the point that I'm not sure I wanna keep
going anymore.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0569]
Steel your resolve. Chin up.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0570]
Then just quit, dude.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0571]
Y'know, you're right. I'm just acting spoiled.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0572]
Um, sorry. I don't know where I get off complainin'
to you about all this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0573]
I appreciate the boost, <playername>.
Even if I still don't really understand what Grandpa's
trying to teach me.<wait><page>
But I'll keep working at it. I hafta trust that
I'll get it someday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0574]
I oughta get back to work.
Catch ya later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0575]
What?! Comin' from someone who doesn't know a flange
from a fillet...! Rrgh, I guess I shouldn'ta complained, but...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0576]
Y'know, I hate to ask, but could you gimme some space
here and head home?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0577]
I'm training right now. Sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0578]
Feel free to read any book that catches your eye.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0579]
Ah... Hey, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0580]
<playername>...
Uh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0581]
There's something I'd like to talk to you about,
if you've got a sec.<wait><page>
Um... Sorry for yelling a while back.
I shouldn't have treated a customer like that.
I really regret it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0582]
Th-Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0583]
I get like that with people I don't know very well.
My temper flares up faster than copper
in a blazin' forge.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0584]
But I'd hate to know that you thought badly of me
because of one blow-up.<wait><page>
Hope you can accept my apology for all that mess.
We good?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0585]
Oh, that reminds me! You ship ore and ore-adjacent stuff,
right, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0586]
It's probably no surprise given my line of work,
but I love ore and gems.<wait><page>
So I was thinking of trying to make some stuff in secret.
Y'know, without Grandpa catching wind.<wait><page>
I need to crank my training up to max heat
if I wanna improve.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0587]
That's only natural, I'd think.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0588]
I'm applying to your fan club. Stat.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0589]
R-Right. It's...only natural.<wait><page>
S-Still, believe me when I say I'm gonna work hard.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0590]
Once I've had a chance to hone my skills a bit, mind if I try
makin' something for you, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0591]
Right on. Just you wait and see.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0592]
It's not that big of a deal.<wait><page>
I've still got a long way to go, but I'm hopin' I can leave
even Grandpa in the dust someday. In smithing, I mean.<wait><page>
Once I've had a chance to hone my skills a bit, I'll make
somethin' especially for you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0593]
K-Keep in mind that I'm only gonna show you if it turns
out right, so don't get your hopes up too high.<wait><page>
But...I'll do my best.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0594]
Oh... Need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0595]
I'm turning up the heat on my training.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0596]
Hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0597]
Grandpa chewed me out again today.
I'm not letting it get to me, though.<wait><page>
In fact, I actually think I'm starting to understand why
he's so hard on me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0598]
Maybe I'm finally startin' to think and act
like a full-fledged blacksmith.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0599]
There's something I'm biting at the bit to ask
you today, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0600]
I don't often see you wearin' jewelry or anything
like that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0601]
A-Are you not really interested in that kinda stuff?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0602]
I live to be adorned in opulence!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0603]
Have you SEEN the dirt under my nails?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0604]
Figured. There're probably plenty of girls out there
who'd say something similar. Maybe in a less...weird way.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0605]
Oh, no, I didn't mean anything bad by that. Honest.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0606]
Um... Are you angry?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0607]
That's good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0608]
There's a reason I came here today.<wait><page>
I wanted to give you this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0609]
It's a brooch I made that I thought'd look nice on you.
Hope you like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0610]
A-Are you interested in fashion at all, 
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0611]
I live to be adorned in opulence!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0612]
Have you SEEN the dirt under my nails?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0613]
Oh, yeah? That's good to hear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0614]
Here. It's a bracelet I made that I thought'd look
nice on you. Hope you like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0615]
I was worried that maybe you didn't need it.
I'm glad you seem to like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0616]
I made that from scratch--all by myself--without
Grandpa knowing.<wait><page>
He's still way better than me, but I'm at least
at the point in my training where I can make simple
stuff like this.<wait><page>
I figured that if it turned out well,
I'd give it to you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0617]
It'd really mean a lot to me to see you get some use
out of it. Well, see you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0618]
Take good care of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0619]
O-Oh... Okay.
I'm, uh...gonna head back now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0620]
Good to see you, <playername>.
Could you come here for a minute?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0621]
It would seem you've been getting on well with my Gray,
<playername>.<wait><page>
No doubt he's inherited my aloof demeanor, so I've been
worried he might be struggling to make friends, but...<wait><page>
I'm glad to see he's taken a shine to you,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0622]
Gray's become increasingly passionate about his training
as of late. I've been impressed by his diligence.<wait><page>
But something seems to be weighing on his heart.
That much is clear from the tools he produces.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0623]
Gray!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0624]
What, Grandpa?<wait><page>
Oh, <playername>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0625]
Gray, you may leave for today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0626]
What're you talking about?
You never let me leave early.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0627]
I've determined that <playername> is the cause of
your emotional distress.<wait><page>
I apologize, <playername>, but could you spare some
time to spend with him today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0628]
I apologize, <playername>, but could you spare some
time to spend with him today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0629]
Sorry... Grandpa says crazy stuff outta the blue
every once in a while. Guess you got caught in the
crossfire today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0630]
Um... Hey. I guess this is a good enough time to ask.<wait><page>
Are you planning on staying in this town long-term,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0631]
Couldn't imagine life anywhere else!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0632]
Who knows what tomorrow will bring.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0633]
Oh! Oh, man, talk about a relief.
Er, wait... I mean...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0634]
Some people only stick around here for a certain amount
of time, like Kai. Kinda like a...reverse snowbird, y'know?<wait><page>
Others, like my old man, end up moving to another
town altogether.<wait><page>
That's why I've been curious about what you're
gonna do, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0635]
In other words...
What I'm tryin' to say is...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0636]
I'd miss you if you went away.
I...don't have many other friends.<wait><page>
And I've especially, um...never been friends with a girl
before, so...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0637]
A-Anyway... If you're staying here, I hope you'll keep bein'
my friend.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0638]
I admit this has been on my mind.
I...feel like I can breathe easy now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0639]
I'd miss you if you went away. I...don't have many other
friends. Especially not someone as special as you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0640]
So there's a possibility you could leave, then?
Oh... All right...<wait><page>
No... It's nothing. Just figured I'd ask.<wait><page>
See ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0641]
No... It's nothing. Just figured I'd ask.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0642]
Well, see ya around.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0643]
Let's chat again soon, yeah?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0644]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0645]
No one will bother us here.
About what you said earlier...<wait><page>
Are you...serious?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0646]
Huh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0647]
Actually, ever since we started dating, I knew this could
happen someday, but my low self-esteem told me
otherwise.<wait><page>
Yet at the same time, my heart was telling me that with
a girlfriend like you by my side...<wait><page>
...I might find the strength to push past whatever's been
holding me back.<wait>

Right, so, if our minds are made up, we'll have to prepare
for the ceremony. I've gotta tell Grandpa, too.<wait>

I see. So you've finally decided to marry.<wait><page>
Congratulations, Gray.
And to you too, <playername>.<wait><page>
He may still be wet behind the ears, but I hope you'll take
good care of my grandson.<wait>

You're still treating me like a little kid at a time like this?
In front of the person I'm gonna marry?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0658]
But of course, my boy.<wait><page>
Now matter how much you mature, or how skilled
of a blacksmith you become, you will always be
my little Gray.<wait><page>
You're my beloved grandson. Don't ever forget that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0659]
Ah...!
Sheesh, Grandpa...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0660]
Now, that's quite enough of that.
This isn't the time to be misty-eyed.<wait><page>
I wish you and my grandson every happiness,
<playername>. He is lucky to have found a woman
like you.<wait><page>
Gray, don't you dare hurt her.<wait>

hold the ceremony in roughly a week.<wait>

My congratulations. Looking upon two young lovebirds is
always a delight, no matter how many years pass me by.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0670]
You both look so happy! Congratulations!<wait>

Phew, that was one heck of a ceremony. The pictures we
took together will make for great memories, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0674]
Grandpa cried in the end.
Seeing him like that really hit me hard.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0675]
We'll be living together in this house from now on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0676]
Uh, I've been wondering... Should we change the names
we call each other?<wait><page>
You can call me whatever you want.<wait><page>
But what do YOU wanna be called, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0677]
Uh... <nickname>. All right.
Then that's what I'll say from now on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0678]
What name sounds good to you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0679]
<nickname>, huh? ∀ 
Yeah, gotta admit, I like the ring of that.
Here's to our new life together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0680]
Just so you know, I'm planning to continue working as
a blacksmith even now that we're married.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0681]
Thanks, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0682]
Well, <nickname>, tomorrow marks the start
of our new life together. I can already tell this
is gonna be great.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0683]
Oh? Pardon me. I didn't realize I still had a patient
to see.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0684]
You're not from this town, are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0685]
Ah, I see. So you're <playername>, the new caretaker
of that farm. There have been rumors floating around
about you.<wait><page>
My name is Doctor. And as you can see, I'm a physician.
If you ever feel unwell, do seek me out right away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0686]
My name is Doctor. And as you can see, I'm a physician.
If you ever feel unwell, do seek me out right away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0687]
Ah, if it isn't <playername>.
Are you eating well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0688]
That's good to hear. A balanced diet is critical
to cultivating a strong, healthy body.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0689]
Most people in this town are healthy.<wait><page>
We live in a place where the abundant blessings of
nature appear to have rendered most diseases impotent.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0690]
But I still study each and every day. Medicine is an
endless pursuit. Many problems remain unsolved,
even now.<wait><page>
What about you, <playername>? Working on the
farm is surely a difficult endeavor in its own right.<wait><page>
Farm work is one of the most physically demanding jobs
out there. Do take care.<wait><page>
Also, for medical matters you'd rather not discuss with
me, you may speak to my nurse, Elly.<wait><page>
In any case, we are always here to lend an ear about any
health concerns you may have.<wait>

Oh! That's right, <playername>.<wait><page>
I just received some medicine from another town.
Would you like to try some?<wait><page>
Unlike the medicine typically sold here, it can restore
both stamina and fatigue at the same time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0693]
Its only fault is that the effect is somewhat weak, which
is why it hasn't been put out on the market yet.<wait><page>
I improved it to increase its effectiveness,
albeit at the expense of flavor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0694]
Yeaaah, I'll pass.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0695]
A little medicine never hurt anyone...
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0696]
It is often said that there is an inverse relationship
between taste and efficacy, so I'm confident it will work.<wait><page>
Even I take some when I'm tired.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0697]
I apologize for trying to force you. I thought that as the
owner of a farm, you might be interested in it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0698]
Y-You do not have to look so pained.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0699]
However, you must not overestimate your own abilities.
An abundance of pride will lead to your downfall.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0700]
Oh ho. It would seem I sized you up correctly. Go on, then.
Down it in one gulp.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0701]
Ah, so it tastes as awful as I expected.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0702]
But it WAS rather effective, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0703]
I had hypothesized that you'd be able to see the value
in this medicine. Would you like some more?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0704]
Haha, forgive me. I couldn't resist a little joke. Taking too
much of any medicine can have negative effects.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0705]
Thank you for today, <playername>.
You've given me a lot to consider.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0706]
Are you quite sure? You won't regret it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0707]
You've a rather adventurous spirit, I must say.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0708]
Hm? You didn't take any?
Well, I can't say I blame you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0709]
The doctor is passionate about his research.
I could stand to learn a lot from him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0710]
<playername>, you came at just the perfect time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0711]
Another new medicine arrived today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0712]
Run awaaay!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0713]
Ooh, yay! Untested substances!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0714]
O-Oh, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0715]
I've never seen anyone run so fast.
Did I do something wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0716]
Aha! I knew you'd be interested!<wait><page>
Pardon me for just a moment. I'll go fetch it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0717]
Just like before, this medicine recovers stamina and
fatigue at the same time, but with twice the efficacy.<wait><page>
Now, <playername>: all in one gulp!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0718]
Ah, but I should warn you about the flavor.
It tastes as horrible as the last one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0719]
However, I trust that you will understand the benefits
of this medicine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0720]
I admire your maturity! Now, go ahead and take it,
if you will.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0721]
How do you feel?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0722]
<playername>!
Stay with me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0723]
Elly, come here! Quickly!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0724]
Yes, sir!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0725]
I sincerely apologize for today.<wait><page>
As a physician, I never should have subjected you
to such peril.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0726]
It seems the stimulus was too potent. And yet, no such
thing happened when I drank it...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0727]
I truly apologize. I went too far.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0728]
You seem to be feeling better now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0729]
What's most important is that there seem to have been
no long-term effects.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0730]
Doctor, please refrain from carelessly testing new
medicine on your patients from now on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0731]
Yes, I'm sorry. I inconvenienced you as well, Elly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0732]
<playername>, I cannot apologize enough for today.<wait><page>
I took advantage of your willingness to help me advance
my study of medicine, and for that, I apologize.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0733]
Please do not let this sour our budding relationship.
I hope to see you again sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0734]
Take care, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0735]
Don't push yourself too hard, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0736]
If you feel ill, come see us immediately.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0737]
Hello, <playername>.
Are you working hard on your farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0738]
Well, I'm glad to hear that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0739]
Oh, by the way, Doctor said he had something to give you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0740]
What could it be?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0741]
Past trauma...is flooding back...
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0742]
There's no need to worry. It's all above board this time.
Even I wouldn't mind having it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0743]
In any case, please go see him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0744]
Hey, <playername>.
I've been waiting for you.<wait><page>
Today, I was thinking I'd give you something I've kept
tucked away.<wait><page>
Until now, I've been putting all my effort into
researching new medicine while doing checkups
on the side.<wait><page>
And most recently, I've been researching...this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0745]
It doesn't QUITE fall within the realm of medical care,
but it's already garnered some popularity among
city folk.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0746]
So I'd like the people of Mineral Town to know about it.<wait><page>
And to that end, I need someone to try it out.<wait><page>
Since you work the hardest day in and day out, I thought
I'd make the request of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0747]
It's called negative ionization therapy, and when applied,
it supposedly has a relaxing effect.<wait><page>
When a person basks in negative ions, their mental state
becomes calmer, and they're able to relax more easily.<wait><page>
For example, when you take a stroll through the forest,
you feel refreshed, correct?<wait><page>
That is because forested areas produce a multitude
of negative ions.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0748]
I'm glad you seem pleased.<wait><page>
Mind over matter, as they say. It just goes to show how
strongly the heart and body are connected.<wait><page>
I've begun to think that the optimal route to wellness is
living optimistically and minimizing stress.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0749]
Of course, there are also people like Lillia, who are born
with an illness.<wait><page>
I plan to continue my research for the sake of people
like her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0750]
Hm? You're impressed that I care so deeply about
my patients?<wait><page>
No, no. I'm only doing what any good physician would.
It's my job.<wait><page>
Still, hearing you say that...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0751]
At my age, I hardly ever receive such frank compliments.<wait><page>
So it's a little embarrassing to have you say that aloud.
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0752]
Let us both continue to pursue our respective passions.
Do tell me if the therapy has noticeable effects.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0753]
You don't seem to be terribly enthused.<wait><page>
I won't force you to do it, but please try to consider
Doctor's feelings.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0754]
The field of medicine is inspirational. I hope to always
retain this enthusiasm for learning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0755]
How nice! Maybe I'll try it myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0756]
<playername>, could you come here for a moment?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0757]
Doctor's acting strangely. He seems to be lost in thought
and has a permanent scowl plastered on his face.<wait><page>
I tried talking to him, but he won't so much as
acknowledge me.<wait><page>
If you don't have any plans today, could you try speaking
with him?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0758]
Thank you. If you would, please.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0759]
Oh, it's you. Hm? Elly is worried about me?<wait><page>
Ah, I hate to have troubled her.
I've been deep in thought today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0760]
I was thinking about how I interact with my patients.
Apparently, something about me makes me difficult
to approach.<wait><page>
I was wondering if there might be something I can
do to that end. What do you think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0761]
Open up your heart.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0762]
Physicians should have boundaries.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0763]
Open up...my heart, you say? I see.<wait><page>
You have rightly assessed that I am the type of man who
doesn't freely speak with others.<wait><page>
Perhaps from their point of view, I have erected a wall
between us.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0764]
It's strange. I've never spoken of my worries with
someone else before, and yet...<wait><page>
Somehow, I feel more at ease when I'm with you,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0765]
For whatever reason, I'm not compelled to hide anything
from you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0766]
Yes... I understand now. This is what it means to open
one's heart.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0767]
It's strange. I've never spoken of my worries with
someone else before, and yet I can easily discuss them
with you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0768]
Thank you. Your reassurance gives me confidence.
I'll continue to work hard.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0769]
Hmmm... Do you truly think so, <playername>?<wait><page>
But I'd rather not have things continue as they are.<wait><page>
I must think of some way...
At any rate, I apologize for troubling you with such
a strange question.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0770]
Thank you, <playername>. I'll do my best
to start opening up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0771]
It is difficult to change oneself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0772]
This is the first time I've ever seen him like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0773]
Now he looks even MORE pensive.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0774]
No one should disturb us here.<wait><page>
About what you mentioned earlier...
Are you serious?<wait><page>
I mean...about marrying me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0775]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0776]
For some reason, my brain refuses to accept this
as reality.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0777]
Even if it IS the future I've imagined ever since
we began dating.<wait><page>
For all my expertise in the realm of medicine,
I still flounder in matters of the heart.
I admit I was biding my time.<wait><page>
If you are willing to put up with me, then of course
my answer is yes. Will you marry me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Aah... I feel as though I'm dreaming.
Let us pursue happiness together,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0780]
Well, then. I'm returning to the Clinic. Please leave all the
wedding preparations to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0781]
Oh, so you two are getting married?
Congratulations!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

May you two find eternal happiness.<wait><page>
Ever since I saw you two speaking so intimately at
Doctor's house...<wait><page>
...I was sure that you would one day tie the knot.<wait><page>
It will be an honor to officiate a wedding between two of
my dear friends.<wait>

<playername>. Doctor. Do you both hereby swear
to take each other as your sole partner for the rest
of your lives...<wait><page>
...To have and to hold, to respect and to cherish,
your hearts united no matter what may come?
For now, and forever?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0792]
You're both positively radiant. ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0793]
<playername>! Doctor!
Best wishes as you enter this new stage of life together!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0794]
What a lovely ceremony. It was the best medicine
I could've asked for today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0795]
<playername>, let us do our best to support
one another.<wait><page>
I am sure that together, we are capable of overcoming
any obstacle.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0796]
So we're finally home. Phew... I'm exhausted.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0797]
But I had a grand time. The ceremony, the reception...
Everyone did so much for us that I almost feel guilty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0798]
And now...our life together begins.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0799]
On that note...<wait><page>
What should I call you from now on?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0800]
Understood, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0801]
You would like some other name?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0802]

continue working at the Clinic for the sake of the
townspeople.<wait>

Okay. I don't think anyone will bother us here.<wait>

saying you want to be boyfriend and girlfriend, right?<wait><page>
Man...to think you would beat me to the punch...<wait>

Of COURSE my answer is yes. I'm thrilled that you want
us to be together!<wait>

[0939]
<playername>, you have no idea how happy this
makes me. I'm your boyfriend...! Really, the pleasure's
all mine.<wait>

See you around!<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0943]
OMELETS ALMIGHTY! <playername>!
What are you doing there?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0944]
No. It's okay. I'm the one who should be apologizing.
I was in such a rush that I didn't even see you there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0945]
Anyway, I'm really glad you stopped by, but I'm busy right
now and I don't think I can get free.<wait><page>
I've finished cataloging our inventory, but now I have to
feed the chickens.<wait><page>
Popuri has taken off to who-knows-where, too, so I can't
even help you at the storefront right now, and--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0946]
What? You'll help me feed the chickens?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0947]
Well, um, I appreciate the thought, but you're a guest
here. I can't ask you to handle store work for me...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0948]
Well, um, I appreciate the thought, but you're a guest
here. I can't ask you to handle store work for me...<wait>

<playername>... Yeah, you have a point. Now is exactly
the sort of time I should be leaning on my girlfriend for
help.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0950]
<playername>... Yeah, you have a point. Now is exactly
the sort of time I should be leaning on my boyfriend for
help.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0951]
Okay, then. If you really don't mind, I'd appreciate
whatever help you can give me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0952]
Okay, then. If you really don't mind, I'd appreciate
whatever help you can give me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0953]
Hey, come back here! Stop creating extra work for
<playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0954]
Hey, come back here! Stop creating extra work for
<playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0955]
Wow, <playername>! Amazing! That one's so shy
that she always runs away. I have the hardest time
wrangling her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0956]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0957]
That's a farmer for you. You're used to caring for
livestock. I guess I don't have to give you directions, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0958]
*sigh* Me, on the other hand... I have both
the store and the chickens to tend to,
and I can't manage either right.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0959]
You're doing your best, babe.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0960]
Guess you've gotta try harder.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0961]
Ahahaha... I guess so. It feels really nice to hear you
say that, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0962]
Ahahaha... I guess so. It feels really nice to hear you
say that, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0963]
Man, I have no idea what I would've done if you hadn't
come along, <playername>.<wait><page>
I bet I would've panicked and rushed around in a tizzy,
making a mess of things left and right.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0965]
Thanks a lot for your help today.
I sincerely needed it, and...it felt good to have you there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0966]
Huh! YOU two sure have gotten extra super friendly
lately, <playername> and Rick.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0967]
My, my! You certainly do seem very, very close
these days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0968]
Mom?! Popuri?! Where the heck have you been?
Do you have any idea how much trouble I've been
having all by myself?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0969]
I'm sorry, Rick. But it looks like you had a great time
with <playername>, so it couldn't have been ALL bad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0970]
Okay, yeah, I'll agree with you on that one, but still...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0971]
But never mind that! We bought lots of yummy snacks,
so can we have tea now? Pretty pleeease?
With sugar on top?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0972]
Sheesh. Next time, stick around and help, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0973]
You got it, Big Bro!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0974]
Yeah... Good point.<wait><page>
I mean, I never would've finished this up so quickly
without you there helping me, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0975]
Yeah... Good point.<wait><page>
I mean, I never would've finished this up so quickly
without you there helping me, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0976]
Thanks for your help. I know you're a busy gal, and I just
ate up a whole bunch of your time. Sorry about that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0977]
Thanks for your help. I know you're a busy guy, and I just
ate up a whole bunch of your time. Sorry about that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0978]
I can handle the rest of the cleanup by myself.
See you later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0979]
Hey, <playername>. Mind if I come in?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0980]
Hey, <playername>. Mind if I come in?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0981]
Sorry to drop in on you like this, <playername>.<wait><page>
I figured you would be finishing up your chores right
about now. Do you have some free time?<wait><page>
It's an awfully nice day, so if you're up for it, why don't
we go out somewhere together?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0983]
Great! Man, I was actually a little worried about what
I was going to do if you were too busy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0984]
Okay, then! Let's head out, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0985]
Okay, then! Let's head out, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0986]
This is a pretty scenic spot, don't you think? Let's rest
a bit here. Oh, and I brought a packed lunch for us, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0987]
This is a pretty scenic spot, don't you think? Let's rest
a bit here. Oh, and I brought a packed lunch for us, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0988]
Phew... This fresh forest air is chock-full of negative ions.
It sure feels good to breathe it in.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0989]
I DO like caring for our chickens, but taking care of living
creatures is a big responsibility I have to take seriously.<wait><page>
You'd be surprised at how hard it is to relax when you're
running a store, too. I really need days off like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0990]
That's why I wanted to spend some time just hanging out
with you, <playername>.<wait><page>
But I also wanted to, y'know, thank you for being so good
to Mom and Popuri. And for helping at the store that one
time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0992]
Forgive me for bringing up a heavy subject, but my dad
just...left us one day, you know. Still hasn't come home.<wait><page>
You've seen how frail my Mom is, and Popuri is still so
young.<wait><page>
I've been pushing myself for their sake. To step up and
take care of not just the store, but my family, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0993]
That gets pretty stressful, y'know? I'm aware that I'm
grumpy and frazzled a lot. I just don't have time to relax.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0994]
But seeing you getting along with Mom and Popuri like
you do, and having you come help at the store...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0995]
But seeing you getting along with Mom and Popuri like
you do, and having you come help at the store...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0996]
It feels so good to have you there for me. I feel like I have
help. Like I'm not trying to do this all alone.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0997]
It feels so good to have you there for me. I feel like I have
help. Like I'm not trying to do this all alone.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0998]
You can lean on me more.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0999]
Let's both keep at it.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1000]
Um, y-yeah. Right. You really are super dependable,
<playername>. I'm glad to have a girl like you in my
corner.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1001]
Um, y-yeah. Right. You really are super dependable,
<playername>. I'm glad to have a guy like you in my
corner.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1002]
But...I don't want to lean on you TOO much.
If I do, I feel like I'll be nothing but a mooch...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1003]
Though if things get really hectic and I know I can't
handle it all myself, I'll definitely ask for your help.
Promise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1004]
Yeah. Thanks, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1005]
Yeah. Thanks, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1006]
I'm supposed to be the man of the house, but here I am
getting bailed out by you all the time, <playername>.<wait><page>
Someday, I want to be capable enough to support you the
way you support me now. To be the man of YOUR house.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1007]
I'm supposed to be the man of the house, but here I am
getting bailed out by you all the time, <playername>.<wait><page>
Someday, I want to be capable enough to support you like
you support me. To be the man of YOUR house. Well, one
of 'em.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1008]
As long as I have you, I think...no, I KNOW that I'll be able
to overcome any obstacle in my way.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1009]
Anyway, it's getting late. Let's head back. I'll walk you to
your farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1010]
Anyway, it's getting late. Let's head back. Last one to
your farm is a rotten egg!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1011]
Thanks a lot for hanging out with me today,
<playername>. I appreciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1012]
Thanks a lot for hanging out with me today,
<playername>. I appreciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1013]
Time sure flies when you're having fun. We'll have to do
something like this again sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1014]
Time sure flies when you're having fun. We'll have to do
something like this again sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1015]
Phew! Man, talk about a panic attack! I swear I felt my
brain oozing outta my ears for a sec there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1016]
Ah. Yeah. Right. You bet your butt I know what that
means. You want us to be boyfriend and girlfriend, right?<wait><page>
Hooooo boy, you have NO idea how happy that makes me,
<playername>! I'm sweatin' bullets here!
Happy bullets!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1017]
Ah. Yeah. Right. You bet your butt I know what that
means. You want us to be boyfriends, right?<wait><page>
Hooooo boy, you have NO idea how happy that makes me,
<playername>! I'm sweatin' bullets here!
Happy bullets!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1018]
Duh. Of course my answer's yes. As of this moment,
I'm the pineapple to your...uh...pineapple tree! 'Kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1019]
Duh. Of course the answer's yes. As of this moment,
we're a pair of GUY-napples growin' on the tree of love!
'Kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1020]
Hahaha! Okay, so that was cheesy.
But I'm stoked for our future together, even if things
don't change much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1021]
Anyway, I'd better get back to work.
See ya soon!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1022]
Yo, <playername>! Welcome!
Come to grab a bite to eat?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1023]
Hm? Y'say that if I've got time for a break, you wanna go
fishing together?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1024]
Haha! Sure thing! The Cafe was just winding down
anyway. Plus, I'm in the mood to get some exercise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1025]
But y'know? While we're at it, why don't we REALLY
stretch our legs and head for the lake to fish there
instead?<wait><page>
I'm only here in summer, and I don't usually wander far
from the beach. I wanna do some exploring with you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1026]
Great! Plan made. Let's blow this popsicle stand.
...Hey, actually, should I add popsicles to the Cafe menu?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1027]
Huh? Is that a chicken over there? What's one doing loose
out here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1028]
Hm? <playername>, what's wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1029]
No way! That's one of YOUR chickens?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1030]
Oops! Crap. I've always been bad at keepin' my volume
down. I startled it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1031]
Hm? You're gonna go after it, and you want me to go
wait at the Cafe while you do? Uh, how 'bout nah?
Lemme help too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1032]
Though thinking about it, having a total chicken-handling
newbie tagging along would be more hindrance than help,
huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1033]
Okay then, <playername>. Don't you worry about me.
Go on and catch your chicken. Break an egg. Er, a leg.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1034]
Aha! You're back. How'd it go?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1035]
From the look of it, I'm gonna assume that everything
turned out just fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1036]
Hm? Sorry for spoilin' our fishing trip? Naaah, don't
worry about it. We'll just go some other time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1037]
Still, THAT was a shocker! Who woulda thought we'd
trip over one of your chickens? THERE, of all places?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1038]
Hahaha! Lemme guess: you've worked up an appetite?
Good thing I thought to fix something up for you ahead
of time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1039]
See, I figured you'd come back tired and hungry from the
ol' chicken chase, so I threw together a little something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1040]
Ooh! Make dessert, too!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1041]
I bow to thee, saint of sustenance!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1042]
Ooh! Free refills too, right?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1043]
I bow to thee, saint of sustenance!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1044]
Whoa, whoa. You expecting me to put together
a full-course meal for you? Eesh. Ah, well.
For you, I guess I can.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1045]
Whoa, whoa! Just how hungry are you? Eesh.
Ah well. For you, I guess so.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1046]
Well, you DID work hard, so you deserve a little treat.
Heck, y'know what? I'll even make dessert for you, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1047]
Well, you DID work hard, so you deserve a little treat.
Heck, y'know what? I'll even make dessert for you, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1048]
Seeing you so happy about my food makes the work I put
into it more than worth it.<wait><page>
Hang on just a sec, <playername>.
I'll whip up that dessert for ya!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1049]
Man, watching you chow down like that makes the work
I put into it more than worth it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1050]
Y'know, now that I think about it, farm work has to be
pretty rough.<wait><page>
Here at my Cafe, I'll sometimes get a fussy customer who
complains over every little thing...<wait><page>
And just getting them calmed down and out the door is
headache enough. But at least I can talk to them.<wait><page>
Animals, on the other hand, can't talk. Getting THEM to
understand has to be way harder than even my crankiest
customer.<wait><page>
That you can handle all of them every day, all by yourself,
is...honestly pretty amazing, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1051]
Anyway, enough of that. The food's not goin' anywhere,
so feel free to pig out for as long as you like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1052]
...And that about sums it up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1053]
Huh. I getcha. Man, there really ARE all kinds of 'em,
huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1054]
Oh, <playername>. Welcome, dearie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1055]
Yo, <playername>! Come to check out some seeds and
get a new crop goin'?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1056]
Ah. Pourin' your blood, sweat, and tears into the farm as
always, eh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1057]
Hm? What, you think it's weird to find me here at the
General Store?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1058]
Hm? What, you think it's weird to find me here at the
General Store?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1059]
Haha! Yeah, you WOULD wonder about
that, wouldn'tcha?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1060]
Haha! Yeah, you WOULD wonder about
that, wouldn'tcha?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1061]
You aren't the only one, dearie. We're just as surprised
to see Kai as you are.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1062]
You hardly ever drop by, dear--only in those rare
instances you happen to run out of something at your
Cafe, right?<wait><page>
And you always wait until our quietest hours to come in,
so our other customers barely ever see you here.<wait><page>
Not only that, but you came today with a question about
THAT, of all things...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1063]
You said it, dear. To think that Kai, of all people,
would come here asking THAT. Surprised us both,
that's for sure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1064]
Ack! Whoa! Hold it, Jeff! Slow your roll, Sasha! I told you
that was all theoretical!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1065]
A-Anyway! <playername>, you're here to do some
shopping, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1066]
I'm sure you're busy as heck with all your farm work and
stuff, so don't mind me! Go on and get what you need.
'Kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1067]
I, uh... I'd better get back to the Cafe. The food ain't
gonna cook itself, y'know! See ya!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1068]
Ah-- And there goes <playername>, too. What in the
world was that all about? Kai looked positively panicked.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1069]
Ah-- And there goes <playername>, too. What in the
world was that all about? Kai looked positively panicked.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1070]
Come now, dear. Can't you put two and two together?
From what Kai asked and how he reacted, it was obvious
to me.<wait><page>
Hee hee. ∀ It's all for <playername>'s sake, isn't it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1071]
Whoa, whoa. <playername>, did you really chase me
all the way here? Don't you have work you should be
doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1072]
No...I know. You followed me because you were worried
about me, right? Thanks. That makes me feel better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1073]
So, uh...yeah. <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1074]
Back at the General Store, I was asking them about
what kinda stuff I'd need if I, y'know...stayed here
year-round.<wait><page>
I asked what the weather's like, what kinda events
the town holds... That sorta thing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1075]
This is all only hypothetical, though!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1076]
We could be together! FOREVER.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1077]
You really like this town, huh?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1078]
We could be together! FOREVER.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1079]
You really like this town, huh?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1080]
Hahaha! Wow, what's up with that reaction, huh?
You really THAT happy to have a goof like me around
all the time?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1081]
You are, eh? Thanks, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1082]
Hey, whoa! Quit it, man! You're makin' me blush.
Seriously, are you really THAT happy to have me
around all the time?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1083]
See, I've been thinking about the future and if I wanna
keep living the way I've been, or if I wanna change
things up.<wait><page>
Watching you work so hard on your farm...<wait><page>
And seeing you go from exhausted to grinning after
one bite of my food... It all got me thinking, y'know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1085]
I had to wonder if I was around more, maybe I could
be a bigger help to you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1086]
I REALLY hate the cold, y'know? I go outta my way to
avoid it, following warm weather wherever it goes
year-round.<wait><page>
But now I'm thinking of staying here. It'd be a pretty
big change, y'know? And it's kinda embarrassing
to talk about.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1087]
Heck, when I brought it up to Jeff and Sasha, their eyes
practically popped right outta their heads.<wait><page>
Then YOU strolled in, and all of a sudden, I got cold feet.
Ah, no pun intended. But that's why I took off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1088]
Ugh. I must've looked like a total dingus back there.
I hope I didn't freak Jeff and Sasha out at all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1089]
Man, now that I think about it, I bet I worried them just
as badly as I worried you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1090]
Once I've come back down to earth and have my head on
straight, I'll go back and explain everything to them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1091]
In the meantime, would you, um...hang out here a bit longer
and watch the ocean with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1092]
In the meantime, would you, um...hang out here a bit longer
and watch the ocean with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1093]
Ah...ha ha...yeah. Right. This town is a nice place, and the
people are really friendly. Anybody'd want to live here.<wait><page>
Though...yeah. This is still all just hypothetical on my part,
'kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1094]
I don't wanna confuse folk into thinking I'm staying when
I haven't decided yet. That's why I ran earlier. I panicked.<wait><page>
But y'know? I'm just not used to other seasons. Living
through them sounds rough. Maybe it's not for me.<wait><page>
Yeah, actually...can we forget I ever brought it up,
<playername>? Just... pretend that it never happened.
Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1095]
I'll have to ask Jeff and Sasha to do the same later, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1096]
I'm still catching my breath... That came out of nowhere,
<playername>. You really shocked me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1097]
I'm still catching my breath... That came out of nowhere,
<playername>. You really shocked me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1098]
Yeah...thanks. I'm so glad to hear that you feel that way,
<playername>.<wait><page>
But, uh...are you sure you're all right with me? I'm just
really worried that you might end up regretting it later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1099]
Yeah...thanks. I'm so glad to hear that you feel that way,
<playername>.<wait><page>
But, uh...are you sure you're all right with me? I'm just
really worried that you might end up regretting it later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1100]
No, wait. I can't be like that. I should treasure this
moment and just be happy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1101]
No, wait. I can't be like that. I should treasure this
moment and just be happy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1102]
So, um, I hope you'll stick with me, <playername>.
I might need a little extra patience throughout
this process.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1103]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1105]
HOLY MACARO-- <playername>?!
H-How long have you been there?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1106]

Thanks for agreeing to it.
Let's go back to town, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1180]
To the Harvest Goddess? I guess that's not a bad idea,
but isn't this a little much for an offering?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1181]
Everyone seemed so happy. It feels like...my own spirits
were lifted a bit, too.<wait>

Oh...but I wonder if bringing them without any notice

You don't think so? We should just go?

Yes, these will work wonders for us! We're so busy at
the Vineyard that we don't have time to go to the forest.<wait>

[1195]
I'm glad you like them.
Well, we'll excuse ourselves now.<wait>

The General Store people...
The Inn people... Carter...
And now Duke and Manna...<wait>

They all greeted us with smiles.
I...was really touched by that.<wait>

Grandpa's out on business right now.<wait>

Sorry, but if you need something from him, you're gonna
have to come back later.<wait>

Hm?
<playername>, your sickle...<wait><page>
Is it chipped?<wait>

[1213]
Hm?

Is it chipped?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

I knew it.<wait><page>
It's almost unnoticeable, but it's chipped, all right.<wait><page>
Even I should be able to fix something that simple.
Sit tight.<wait><page>
Hm... Actually, on second thought...<wait><page>
You're probably better off just waiting till Grandpa
gets back.<wait><page>
If I tried to fix it and made some kinda mistake,
it'd only make things worse.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1215]
Huh? You WANT me to fix it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1216]
...<wait><page>
...Okay.<wait><page>
You can breathe easy.
I promise I'll fix it.<wait><page>
I'm not about to ruin one of your most important tools,

I did it.
One sickle, good as new.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1221]
I'm glad it went well. I felt surprisingly confident when
I was in the heat of the moment.<wait><page>
And Grandpa recently told me that if I feel like I can fix
something, then I should go ahead and do it.<wait><page>
Still, I was pretty nervous about repairing something
that wasn't mine for the first time. My hands were
sweating.<wait><page>
But it was YOUR sickle, after all. That's what gave me
the drive to fix it.<wait>

Um... I'm still an apprentice blacksmith, so I don't have
much time to help you on the farm.<wait><page>
But I CAN repair and help maintain your farming
equipment.<wait><page>
So while I may not be there to, say, care for your
livestock, maybe I can indirectly help you via your tools.<wait><page>
That's why now, more than ever, I need to focus harder
on my training and become a full-fledged blacksmith.<wait>

[1235]

You still have a long way to go.<wait><page>
But...you've improved.<wait>

Devote yourself to your training and remain diligent.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1239]
Haha... I did it.<wait><page>
It's not like I repaired it just to have Grandpa praise me,
but...<wait><page>
I've gotta admit it's a nice bonus.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1240]
But...what IS it that I lack?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1241]
Confidence?<wait><page>
I mean, it's true that I'm not always confident in my skills.
I beat myself up about it a lot.<wait><page>
Hmmm...<wait><page>
Maybe that timid attitude is exactly why I was missing
opportunities to grow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1242]
Thanks, <playername>.<wait><page>
Since we started dating, I feel like the fog clouding my
eyes has started to clear. Dramatic, I know, but...<wait><page>
Maybe this is my moment to shine. Just you watch.
I'll become a full-fledged blacksmith before you
know it.<wait>

[1248]
Hey, Ran.<wait><page>
Do you think Gray's been smiling more often recently?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1249]
Huh? Has he?
I haven't really noticed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1250]
He definitely has.<wait><page>
Well, honestly, he hardly EVER smiled before. As long as
I've known him, he's had resting scowl face.<wait><page>
But now look at him.
He's grinning from ear to ear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1251]
Uh, I guess now that you mention it, you might be right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1252]
Anyway, Dad, you need to hurry up and bring them
their drinks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1253]
Oops, that's right.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1254]
Here are your drinks. Enjoy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1255]
Oh, thank you.
Put them right there, please.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1256]
Gray...
You've changed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1257]
Have I?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1258]
Yeah. You look a lot happier than you did before.<wait><page>
Before, you were more...
How should I put it?
You were always flaring up at Saibara.<wait><page>
And you had an air of inexperience about you,
like you were fumbling around and couldn't
figure out how to improve.<wait><page>
But now, you practically radiate self-assurance.
It's inspiring, really.<wait><page>
You've grown so much in such a short amount of time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1259]
C'mon, did I really seem THAT incompetent?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1260]
Haha! Sorry.<wait><page>
It wasn't my intention to insult you. I was only trying to
say that you've grown into a fine man.<wait><page>
Here, drinks are on the house today. Please accept them
as an apology for my slip of the tongue.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1261]
Hmmm... Have I changed that much?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1262]
Huh, you think so? Well, if you say so, who am I to argue?<wait><page>
Maybe I HAVE grown.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1263]
Maturity looks good on you.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1264]
You have much yet to learn, grasshopper.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1265]
You don't say?<wait><page>
It's true that before I started dating you, all I cared
about was getting Grandpa's approval.<wait><page>
Looking back now, it's clear that I had my head
in the clouds.<wait><page>
Once I felt like I had a firm goal...
Once I committed to being good enough to stand
by your side...<wait><page>
...I had so much motivation that it was practically comin'
out my ears.<wait>

I feel like you and I could have a very special relationship,

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1275]
Allow me to pencil that into your chart, and...there.
Diagnosis: officially dating... Sorry, physician's humor.<wait><page>
I'll be heading back, then. I have something I need to do.
See you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1276]
Hey, <playername>.<wait><page>
I realize this is a bit sudden, but would you come
to my home?<wait>

[1277]
Oh, there's nothing amiss. Carter simply heaped some wild
herbs and mushrooms on me, so...<wait><page>
...I thought I'd take the opportunity to make some
medicinal herb coffee. Hmm? Most people would just
say "tea"?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1278]
Don't worry.
I've already tested it this time.<wait><page>
It turned out amazingly well, so I wanted to share some
with you after everything you've imbibed on my behalf.<wait><page>
Will you come?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1279]
Excellent. Let's be off, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1280]
Hello, <playername>.
I hope I am not intruding.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1281]
Hello, <playername>.
I hope I am not intruding.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1282]
Right, I'll get straight to the kitchen and make a cup for
you as well, <playername>.<wait><page>
Please, have a seat. It should only take a moment.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1283]
<playername>...
You seem a bit dubious yet.
Well, that's only natural.<wait><page>
Doctor has...encouraged...me to sample his medicines as
well, so I understand how you feel.<wait><page>
But this time, he really has succeeded in concocting
something remarkable. I didn't even taste the mushrooms
in it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1285]
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Here you are. Drink up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1286]
It's good, you say? Well, of course it is! I wouldn't have
prescribed you yet ANOTHER harrowing taste test!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1287]
Hm? You'd have no trouble drinking this on a daily basis,
even? A-Ah, well, funny you should say that...<wait><page>
I...may have failed to make note of the recipe I used.<wait><page>
I didn't adjust the flavor at all, and yet for some reason,
it turned out delicious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1288]
In other words...this is a product of pure happenstance.
Hardly scientific, I know.<wait><page>
Whether or not I'll be able to recreate today's success
depends on the herbs Carter brings.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1289]
Don't be dependent on others.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1290]
Write down the recipe next time.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1291]
Y-You may as well take a scalpel and cut me to the bone
next time, <playername>.<wait><page>
For your information, I made the coffee all by myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1292]
Y-Yes, you're absolutely right.
Sorry... Ha ha ha...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1293]
Ha ha ha...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1294]
You and Doctor make a wonderful couple,
<playername>.<wait><page>
I'm glad he's found a good partner.<wait><page>
He can be a tad eccentric sometimes, after all.
No ordinary woman could keep him in check.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1296]
Not you too, Carter. What is it about me that inspires
this sort of snark...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1297]
Well, for one thing, normal people don't force someone
they just met to take medicine that's still under
development.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1298]
H-How did you know I...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1299]
Haha, I wonder...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1300]
Well...I certainly admit that may not have been the most
ethical thing to do.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1301]
That really was exceptionally rude of me,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1302]
Hm? I only did it because I'm so passionate about my
research, you say?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1303]
Hearing you say that is a relief.<wait><page>
That helps me regain confidence that the choices I've
made have not all been complete mistakes.<wait><page>
Thank you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1304]
Each of us are preordained to meet the person who best
complements us. Who acts as a foil to our foibles.<wait><page>
And we owe it all to the Goddess' gracious guidance.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1305]
Yes... I honestly believe that.<wait><page>
With your aid, I will continue working to revolutionize the
world of medicine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1306]
My, my. That is certainly a fine and lofty goal, but...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1307]
...Perhaps you could first focus on learning to write down
recipes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1308]
Y-Yes, you don't have to tell me twice...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1309]
Hey, <playername>.<wait><page>
I was thinking about going for a stroll to get my mind off
of work for a little while.<wait><page>
Would you care to join me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1310]
All right, then. Let's be off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1311]
Oh ho, it's Doctor and <playername>.
Hello there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1312]
Hello, Mugi.
You've been doing well, I trust?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1313]
Of course.<wait><page>
These old bones feel sturdier than ever, no doubt thanks
to you leaping to my aid back when I needed it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1314]
That's good to hear.
But please do be careful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1315]
Even if it was only a simple sprain of the wrist, failing to
exercise caution during the healing process will only--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1316]
Yes, Doctor, I'll be careful.<wait><page>
Oh, by the way. You're welcome to this milk from my
ranch, if you'd like.<wait><page>
I was just headed to the Clinic to give it to you as thanks
for your care.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1317]
Well, now...
That's very considerate. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1318]
Not a worry, Doctor.<wait><page>
Well, if you'll excuse me...
Have a good time with <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1319]
Thomas. Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1320]
Well, if it isn't Doctor and <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1321]
Oh, by the way, Doctor...
I just stopped by Lillia's place.<wait><page>
It seems the new medicine you prescribed is very
effective. She's delighted with it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1322]
Is that so?
Well, that's great to hear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1323]
Lillia wanted to thank you as well, so maybe you could
stop by her place when your schedule opens up, hm?<wait><page>
She's grateful for the medicine, but also very happy that
you were more talkative during your last house call.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1324]
She...said that, did she?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1325]
That she did.<wait><page>
Incidentally, Ellen was saying the same thing: that your
visits tend to run longer than they used to.<wait><page>
As Mayor, I can't tell you how much that pleases me.
I hope you'll continue taking good care of the
townspeople.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1326]
It may come as a surprise to you, but this sort of thing is
a recent development.<wait><page>
Previously, no one would stop to chat with me when I was
out and about unless it was a medical emergency.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1327]
I believe I said as much before, yes? That I've been told
I have this...intimidating air about me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1328]
Since then, I have been wracking my brain to find
a solution.<wait><page>
One change I've made is making idle conversation when
I meet with patients who have come for a checkup.<wait><page>
Ever since we started dating, I've tried to reflect on
your good habits and mimic them where applicable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1330]
You slide into conversation with anyone and everyone like
it's a matter of course, you see.<wait><page>
And you give gifts to the townspeople to establish
good relations.<wait><page>
That's why I'm trying to learn from your example.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1331]
And now, when the townspeople see me on the road,
they've started to talk to me.<wait><page>
I never paid it any mind before, but...<wait><page>
...opening your heart to others is an unexpectedly fulfilling
experience.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1332]
Don't be a copycat.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1333]
Your hard work paid off.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1334]
Oh... I apologize. Should I have gotten your permission
first?<wait><page>
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1335]
Yes. That presence of mind might have been exactly what
I was lacking--not just as a physician, but as a man.<wait><page>
Actively seeking out others to cultivate relationships...
It may come naturally to you, but not to me.<wait><page>
I deeply respect that aspect of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1336]
<playername>, I'm sure there are yet many ways in
which I am ignorant of other people's feelings.<wait><page>
It may be an inconvenience to you, but...<wait><page>
...I would be grateful if you would point out when
I'm behaving in such a manner.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1337]
Yes. I'll be counting on you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1338]
Hn? And you are?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1339]
Ah, I know. You're that new farmer who just moved in,
ain'tcha? Thomas told us all about you.<wait><page>
Name's Gotts. I'm the carpenter around here. If you're
ever lookin' to renovate your house, come see me.<wait><page>
Farm work ain't a walk in the park, I'm sure. Good luck
and try not to throw your back out, eh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1340]
Yo, <playername>. Good to see ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1341]
Oh yeah. <playername>, while you're here, lemme
introduce the guy I'm sharin' a roof with.<wait><page>
Yo, Brandon!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1342]
What is it, Gotts? Inspiration presently beckons, and my
hands are heeding the call...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1343]
This here's <playername>, who just moved into town.<wait><page>
<playername>, this is Brandon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1344]
Aah. It's you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1345]
What, you two know each other already?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1346]
In a manner of speaking...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1347]
Great! That makes this easier.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1348]
See, Brandon's an artist. He does all kinda artsy stuff,
like carving and sculpting and what-have-you.<wait><page>
Found him out cold in the woods. Spent so long lookin'
for good lumber to work with that he keeled right over,
he said.<wait><page>
I couldn't turn my back on a poor sap like that,
so now I'm lettin' him freeload here with me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1349]
"Freeload"? Please. You could at least say I am simply
rooming with you.<wait><page>
Anyway, <playername>, the pleasure is all mine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1350]
Ah, to heck with it. He's quiet and a little weird, but he
ain't a bad guy. Do me a favor and treat him right,
wouldja?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1351]
...Hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1352]
Ah. <playername>.<wait><page>
I am busy at the moment. If you have no business with me,
come back la--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1353]
No. I take that back.<wait><page>
<playername>, I have a question for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1354]
Avant-garde. Sinful. Free. What image do those three
words conjure in your mind?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1355]
...No, no. Never mind. Forget I asked.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1356]
I received a commission for a piece featuring those
themes, but I am having trouble finding the proper
inspiration.<wait><page>
I was hoping that an outside perspective might serve to
kindle my creative embers; thus, I asked you.<wait><page>
But it is ultimately my problem, not yours. If nothing
comes to mind, that is fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1357]
Maybe...something feline?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1358]
Maybe...something with chains?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1359]
Something...feline? Quite an intriguing angle you've taken.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1360]
Yet... It is a strangely compelling answer. Hrm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1361]
Hm...<wait><page>
I can see how that would evoke the theme of sinfulness,
but not...<wait><page>
No. Wait. I suppose I CAN see how it could be connected
with the theme of freedom.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1362]
Cats and chains...
Breaking free...
Hrm. I see, I see.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1363]
Aha. Inspiration strikes. I have found a path,
and now I have but to tread it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1364]
...I can see I've confused you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1365]
For inspiration to strike, one first needs a spark.<wait><page>
Communing with nature. Eating a meal. Speaking with
others.<wait><page>
The spark can come from anywhere, but it is more likely
to appear when doing something out of the ordinary.<wait><page>
That is why I chose to speak with you.<wait><page>
I have a distaste for meaningless chatter, but I am not
foolish enough to consider ALL conversation meaningless.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1366]
Put simply: the time I spent speaking with you had both
meaning and purpose.<wait><page>
Thanks to that, I believe I can create a worthwhile piece.
You have my gratitude.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1367]
Now, then, I must allow inspiration to make this idea
manifest. Please do not disturb me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1368]
Ah. <playername>. What is it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1369]
Aah, so this piece caught your eye, did it?<wait><page>
Its theme is "thoughts from beyond the infinite cosmos."
It remains a work in progress.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1370]
One evening, I happened to dream that I was floating,
weightless, within the inky blackness of space.<wait><page>
I decided to put the inspiration from that dream into
physical form, and this is the result of my work so far.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1371]
Hrm? Being able to take one's dreams and give them
form is amazing, you say? Oh, no. It is nothing special
at all.<wait><page>
To me, anyone who CAN'T give form to their imagination
simply hasn't tried hard enough yet.<wait><page>
If one wishes to create, even if they have yet to solidify
their inspiration into a concrete image...<wait><page>
...they must at least have a vague notion of what that
image might be, no?<wait><page>
Take that vague notion, work at it with enough diligence
and patience, and eventually, it will take shape.<wait><page>
It is not a matter of innate talent.
It is a matter of getting used to the process. That's all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1372]
Personally, I cannot understand those undisciplined souls
who give up before their efforts come to fruition.<wait><page>
How can they leave that beautiful spark of inspiration
buried within them? How can they not give it form
and life?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1373]
Everyone has their own inner universe that belongs to
them and them alone.<wait><page>
If everyone could tap into that universe and give it
form--SHARE it--then our world would be all the richer.
THAT is art.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1374]
Do you want to take a closer look at this piece?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1375]
Do as you please. I am going to brew myself some coffee.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1376]
Erm...<wait><page>
You seemed to be enjoying yourself examining that piece,
so I got a little curious about what it made you feel.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1377]
Enchanting! Beautiful! Now THIS is art!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1378]
I'm more interested in the artist.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1379]
I see. It is always pleasant to be on the receiving end of
praise for one's work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1380]
I assume that means you want to know more about my
creative process?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1381]
...You're interested in ME, hm? Your curiosity is piqued by
the most dull and meaningless things.<wait><page>
Unless you look at me through the lens of my art, I am
nothing but a dull human, devoid of any nuance or merit.<wait><page>
It is my art that makes me who I am.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1382]
You know, it is difficult to tell at first glance, but you are
actually quite the eccentric yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1383]
If you weren't, why else would you be conversing with me
for this long?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1384]
Most people exchange a few words with me and then
promptly take their leave.<wait><page>
I do not mean to be unkind, but I am aware that I tend
to be...blunt in my speech.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1385]
Not that I am particularly concerned about it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1386]
Hm. Ah, I know. About that piece you looked at earlier...<wait><page>
I have a miniature model version of it here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1387]
It is yours, if you wish. I have named it "The Looming
Nightmare: Insomnia."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1388]
Come again sometime.<wait><page>
I wouldn't mind continuing to hear your impressions
of my work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1389]
Yo, <playername>. Lookin' for Brandon?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1390]
Sorry, but now probably ain't the time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1391]
See, he's goin' at his work like a man possessed right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1392]
Forgets to eat. Forgets to sleep. And--as you probably
saw--he forgets to clean up after himself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1393]
Ah, well. I hafta head out to work, so when he finally
comes up for air, could you give him a message?<wait><page>
Tell him to tidy up for me, wouldja?
Thanks. Welp, I'm off. Later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1394]
<playername>. I didn't know you were here.<wait><page>
I'm afraid I am busy at the moment. Unless you are here
on critical business, come back later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1395]
Gotts says "get tidying, buster."
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1396]
Want me to clean up for you?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1397]
Gotts wants me to clean up the mess?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1398]
Hrm. Yes, this room has taken on a rather disorderly air,
I suppose.<wait><page>
But I cannot afford to be distracted now. I must return
to my work.<wait><page>
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1399]
I promise I will clean once I reach a suitable stopping
point. See you later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1400]
Hm? You are offering to clean for me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1401]
But...erm...<wait><page>
All right. I hate to ask you to dirty your hands--literally--
but if you wouldn't mind...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1402]
What? But I couldn't...<wait><page>
Though... I do cause enough bother for Gotts as it is.
I ought not cause more.<wait><page>
Well, then if you wouldn't mind, could I ask
for your assistance?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1403]
Phew...There. Complete at last.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1404]
Aah. <playername>. I just finished.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1405]
Hrm. This room is so clean, I almost failed to recognize it.
Thank you. Your help is appreciated.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1406]
...This always happens when I get caught up in my work.<wait><page>
Without your help, I would undoubtedly have been
subjected to Gotts rebuking me yet again upon his return.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1407]
I'm back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1408]
Whoa! This place is so clean, I could eat dinner off the
dang floor! Not that I'm gonna.<wait><page>
I knew asking you to pass the message along was the
right idea, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1409]
See, when Brandon gets absorbed in his work, he doesn't
hear a word I say, even if I shout till I'm blue in the face.<wait><page>
But you, <playername>? I figured he just might
hear ya. That's why I asked.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1410]
Come to think of it, I don't recall ever conversing much
with others while I'm in the midst of my work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1411]
You're just not hearin' it. I try to talk to you every single
time, remindin' you to, y'know, maybe EAT and SLEEP.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1412]
Really? Fascinating. I don't recall hearing so much
as a word to that end.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1413]
*sigh* That's just the kinda guy you are, I guess.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1414]
...<wait><page>
What? You started this conversation.<wait><page>
I will wait. Organize your thoughts and start from
the beginning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1415]
Ah. I believe I'm beginning to grasp the outline of what
you are saying.<wait><page>
Essentially, you wish for the two of us to take our
relationship to a romantic level.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1416]
Hrm. With you by my side, I can see my art ascending
to entirely new heights.<wait><page>
All right. I accept. As of now, you are my girlfriend,
and I am your boyfriend.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1417]
Ah. I believe I'm beginning to grasp the outline of what
you are saying.<wait><page>
Essentially, you wish for the two of us to take our
relationship to a romantic level.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1418]
Hrm. With you by my side, I can see my art ascending
to entirely new heights.<wait><page>
All right. I accept. As of now, you are my boyfriend,
and I am yours.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1419]
I look forward to exploring this relationship with you.<wait><page>
Now then, I must go. My work awaits me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1420]
<playername>...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1421]
Er, no. It is not anything particularly important.<wait><page>
It's just... Now that we are dating, it occurs to me that
I know next to nothing about YOUR work.<wait><page>
So I thought I ought to come watch you and learn what
you do firsthand.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1422]
Er, no. It is not anything particularly important.<wait><page>
It's just... Now that we are dating, it occurs to me that
I know next to nothing about YOUR work.<wait><page>
So I thought I ought to come watch you and learn what
you do firsthand.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1423]
Hrm. This is actually a rather sizable farm.
And you manage it all yourself?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1424]
You maintain this house on your own as well, I assume...
Hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1425]
There is a crack here.<wait><page>
Leave it be, and before long, you will be contending with
a most fearsome draft.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1426]
It would probably be prudent to leave the repairs to
Gotts, but...ah well.<wait><page>
Lend me a hammer. I will fix it for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1427]
There. That ought to do it for this spot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1428]
Hm? You're surprised I was able to repair it?
Well, of course I have the skill.<wait><page>
I am freeloa--ahem. I am RESIDING with Gotts,
a capable carpenter.<wait><page>
I do occasionally assist him with repairs and the like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1429]
You know what? I may as well finish the job.
Let me inspect everything and fix whatever
seems to be in disrepair.<wait><page>
If you would assist me, please?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1430]
Phew... That ought to do it.<wait><page>
I've actually worked up quite a sweat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1431]
Talk about a deft hand! Thanks!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1432]
So you really CAN help others.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1433]
Don't worry about it.<wait><page>
You have helped me many a time. It is only proper
that I return the favor.<wait><page>
Besides...I can infer much about you just by looking
at your farm.<wait><page>
You take your farm work seriously, selflessly giving
it your all day in and day out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1434]
Seeing that, I just...felt like doing something to help.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1435]
Did you not hear what I said?<wait><page>
I told you that I will, on occasion, help Gotts with his
carpentry work.<wait><page>
If repairing someone else's home does not fall under
"helping others," I do not know what you would call it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1436]
Ah, well. I simply felt like helping you on a whim. Besides,
it was not entirely fruitless for me, either.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1437]
Looking at your farm has fanned the flames
of my imagination.<wait><page>
A domicile resplendent with the warm glow of life
and joy... I now have a clear idea of what constitutes
a "farm."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1438]
Now then, I must be off. This inspiration needs to be given
form as quickly as possible.<wait><page>
Until next time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1439]
I've eaten so much, and yet it's STILL not enough.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1440]
Uh, Brandon, I hate to say this, but... You keep this up and
I'm gonna have to roll ya to bed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1441]
My standard activity level is sufficient to burn the
calories I consume, so there is little worry of that
happening.<wait><page>
Besides, no matter how rotund I become, I will not cease
to be myself. Thus, I see no need to change my behavior.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1442]
Yo, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1443]
Lemme tell ya, these artist types are borderline
impossible to wrap your head around.<wait><page>
He ain't listening to me, so YOU try tellin' him he's gotta
eat some real food before he makes himself sick.<wait><page>
Me? I've gotta head out to work. Besides, watching him
like this is gonna give me heartburn REAL fast.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1444]
...<wait><page>
Ah. It is you. Yes? I am presently contending with a most
pernicious problem.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1445]
You see...I am in a slump.<wait><page>
I woke up one morning, and suddenly I was devoid of
inspiration. Not so much as a single spark has visited
me since. <wait><page>
When I am out of sorts like this, my habit is to eat
nothing but sweets until the condition passes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1446]
Yes. I am aware it is unhealthy. I assure you,
that particular lecture is one I have heard
time and again.<wait><page>
Yet I do not know of any other way to free myself
from a slump. Thus, I walk the only avenue I know
how to traverse.<wait><page>
Eating sweets has become a ritual of mine. After all,
the brain demands sugar after it has been used
extensively, no?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1447]
Hrm. No, I am afraid I could not tell you when I last ate
a proper, nutritious meal.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1448]
What? YOU will prepare something for me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1449]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1450]
All right. If you insist upon demonstrating your culinary
prowess to me, the least I can do is sample it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1451]
Hmm. Now what do I want to make for him?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1452]
Something light with veggies.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1453]
Something heavy and filling.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1454]
Mm. A pleasant odor, that.<wait><page>
I can't say I enjoy many vegetables, but it is possible my
body's desire for vitamins is overruling my taste buds.<wait><page>
Besides, after gorging on sweets, this seems like a
pleasantly light cap to my dining experience.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1455]
My stomach is already full of sugar, and now you want
me to supplement that with another heavy, filling meal?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1456]
And yet...you DID make it for me.
Okay. I will eat it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1457]
Thank you. I daresay that was quite delicious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1458]
Am I out of my slump now, you ask?<wait><page>
No. Of course not. Slumps are not so easily shrugged off.<wait><page>
They are, metaphorically speaking, like being in a tunnel
with no visible exit.<wait><page>
All one can do is keep walking. When the exit will be
found, no one can say.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1459]
However...I must admit, I am feeling delightfully relaxed
right now.<wait><page>
Perhaps I had stressed myself into that unfortunate
state without realizing it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1460]
...When I create, I usually listen to the voices of
my materials, and sculpt them into the form they
have chosen.<wait><page>
When I carve wood, I mind the voice of the lumber.
When I sculpt clay, I pay heed to the voice of the clay.<wait><page>
But when I fall into a slump, it is as if I have gone deaf.
The voices of my materials no longer reach me.<wait><page>
If I cannot hear their voices, I cannot create. That is why
slumps frighten me. In fact, little terrifies me more.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1461]
Do you not understand what I am saying? I must seem
positively deranged to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1462]
Hm. Of course.<wait><page>
Therein lies the reason why I do not speak of this
to anyone else. They would only think me crazy.
They always have.<wait><page>
But in your case...I believed that even if you did not
comprehend, you would at least listen earnestly,
and not laugh.<wait><page>
In fact...I think I WANT you to understand.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1463]
It's strange.<wait><page>
I am still trapped in a slump, but for some reason, it is as
if my mind is clear. I feel refreshed, even.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1464]
You are an odd person.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1465]
It's strange.<wait><page>

You are an odd person.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1466]
I think I'd like to interpret you via an art piece someday.
You would be smooth and flowing, with a sky-blue hue...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1467]
Hm...? Wait. There it is. The sudden spark of inspiration!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1468]
Aaah... It would seem I have come to the end of the tunnel
at long last.<wait><page>
Wait right there. Something tells me I will be able to
complete this piece quickly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1469]
It's finished!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1470]
<playername>. This piece found its life because of
you.<wait><page>
Accordingly, I think you should have it. I call it...<wait><page>
"Life's Mystery and Milk: A Sculpture of Earth's Bounty
and the Chasm of Love."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1471]
There. Now that my work is complete, I have a little free
time. Why not stay for a bit?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1472]
I find I've been struck by the urge to talk with you some
more. Will you humor me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1473]
We should be able to have a quiet discussion here.
Now, please continue where you left off.<wait><page>
...Are you serious?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1474]
Are you really, truly certain you want...me?<wait><page>
Do you honestly want a man like me at your side for the
rest of your life?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1475]
I see. Then my answer goes without saying.<wait><page>
I do not indulge in romantic relations as a mere flight of
fancy. I take them seriously.<wait><page>
Since the moment I agreed to be your boyfriend, I have
envisioned this future.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1476]
Allow me to accompany you along the path of life as it
winds through the remainder of our waking days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1478]
I must admit this does not yet feel real, but...I brim with
enthusiasm for our future together, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1479]
Now, I'd best announce the good news. Gotts, at least,
deserves to know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1480]
Now, I'd best announce the good news. Gotts, at least,
deserves to know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1481]
Oh ho! So you two finally decided to tie the knot?<wait><page>
That's wonderful! Congrats, Brandon! And you too,
<playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1483]
Now, you just leave all the setup for the ceremony and
everything to me.<wait><page>
I'll ask Mayor Thomas to gimme a hand. I'm sure he'll help
me find a good spot and send out the invites for you.<wait><page>
With all that's gotta be done, I'd say it'll take about
a week to get it all ready to go.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

[1485]
If you would be so kind. Thank you.<wait><page>
And...Gotts?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1486]
Hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1487]
Thank you very much for all you've done to help me.
I would not be where I am today without you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1488]
Oh, quit it.<wait><page>
It's not as if two quiet guys like us are suddenly gonna
start chattin' up a storm.<wait><page>
You movin' out isn't gonna be any earth-shattering
change, so don't you worry yourself 'bout me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1489]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1490]
But, well...<wait><page>
I'd be lyin' if I said I never looked at you and thought...<wait><page>
...that if my girl was still alive, she'd be about your age.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1491]
Gotts, I...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1492]
I'll leave your atelier just the way it is. Come on over and
use it whenever you please.<wait><page>
You two be happy now, hear?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1493]
We will.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1494]
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
<playername> and Brandon joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1495]
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
<playername> and Brandon joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1496]
<playername>. Brandon. Do you both hereby swear
to take each other as your sole partner for the rest
of your lives...<wait><page>
...To have and to hold, to respect and to cherish,
your hearts united no matter what may come?
For now, and forever?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1497]
Brandon, you'd better stay real sweet on
<playername> now, y'hear?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1498]
Nothing quite like a good wedding to get the tears
flowing and the heart beating. Congrats to you both!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1499]
Seeing two joyous souls joined as one fills MY heart with
positive energy too. I wish you both the best.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1500]
<playername>. I realize that I am blunt, and that may
cause you grief in the future.<wait><page>
But I promise that I will treat you more tenderly than
anyone. I look forward to spending my life with you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1501]
Finally, we are home. I am exhausted. But I will admit
that was a lovely ceremony.<wait><page>
Seeing your face aglow with happiness and pride was the
greatest gift I could have received.<wait><page>
To think that from now on, we will both be living here...
Together. As a couple.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1502]
Ah, yes. I gave it some thought, and...would it not be
interesting to give each other new nicknames?<wait><page>
I, of course, am happy with you calling me "Brandon," as
you always have. What do you want me to call you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1503]
<nickname>? I see. If you wish it so, then that is
what I will call you from now on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1504]
You want me to call you something else? Such as?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1505]
Well then, <nickname>. Allow me to express once
more how much I look forward to spending my life
with you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1506]
Oh...it's you, <playername>.
...Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1507]
Oh, it's you, <playername>.
...Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1508]
I appreciate the boost, <playername>.
Even if I still don't really understand what Grandpa's
trying to teach me.<wait><page>
But I'll keep working at it. I hafta trust that I'll get
it someday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1509]
Ah... Hey, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1510]
<playername>...
Uh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1511]
There's something I'd like to talk to you about, if you've
got a sec.<wait><page>
Um... Sorry for yelling a while back.
I shouldn't have treated a customer like that.
I really regret it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1512]
But I'd hate to know that you thought badly of me
because of one blow-up.<wait><page>
Hope you can accept my apology for all that mess.
We good?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1513]
Oh, that reminds me! You ship ore and ore-adjacent stuff,
right, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1514]
Once I've had a chance to hone my skills a bit, mind if I try
makin' something for you, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1515]
It's not that big of a deal.<wait><page>
I've still got a long way to go, but I'm hoping I can leave
even Grandpa in the dust someday. In smithing, I mean.<wait><page>
Once I've had a chance to hone my skills a bit, I'll make
somethin' especially for you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1516]
Hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1517]
There's something I'm biting at the bit to ask you today,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1518]
There's a reason I came here today.<wait><page>
I wanted to give you this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1519]
I made that from scratch--all by myself--without
Grandpa knowing.<wait><page>
He's still way better than me, but I'm at least
at the point in my training where I can make simple
stuff like this.<wait><page>
I figured that if it turned out well,
I'd give it to you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1520]
What, Grandpa?<wait><page>
Oh, <playername>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1521]
Um... Hey. I guess this is a good enough time to ask.<wait><page>
Are you planning on staying in this town long-term,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1522]
Some people only stick around here for a certain amount
of time, like Kai. Kinda like a...reverse snowbird, y'know?<wait><page>
Others, like my old man, end up moving to another
town altogether.<wait><page>
That's why I've been curious about what you're gonna do,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1523]
Uh, I've been wondering... Should we change the names we
call each other?<wait><page>
You can call me whatever you want.<wait><page>
But what do YOU wanna be called, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1524]
Take care, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1525]
Hello, <playername>.
Are you working hard on your farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1526]
Oh, by the way, Doctor said he had something to give you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1527]
<playername>, could you come here for a moment?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1528]
Doctor's acting strangely. He seems to be lost in thought
and has a permanent scowl plastered on his face.<wait><page>
I tried talking to him, but he won't so much as
acknowledge me.<wait><page>
If you don't have any plans today, could you try speaking
with him?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1529]
So are you visiting from Crazytown, or...?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1530]
You should be more careful.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1531]
How many times have I heard something along those
lines? At this point, that sentiment is as water off a
duck's back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1532]
Now that's astounding. Are you legitimately concerned
for my well-being?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1533]
I...will exercise more caution from here on out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1534]
Rick, sweetie. <playername>. I wish you two all the
best. I just know you'll build the loveliest little family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1535]
Now that we're married, should we, um, call each other
something different?<wait><page>
I'm fine with you continuing to call me "Cliff."<wait><page>
But what should I call you, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1536]
Oh, you both look so lovely! ♪ Goodness, I...I think I'm about
to cry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
