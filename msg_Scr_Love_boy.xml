[0017]
You just started your farm, right? It's a headache trying
to figure out where even to begin, I'm sure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0018]
You'll need seeds for your crops and seeds for Fodder to
feed your animals, not to mention the tools to sow them...<wait>

The list of things to buy and to do goes on and on.
You following so far?<wait>

I, uh, could use some help...

Of course. I don't blame you.
Here, hang on just a second.<wait>

What, really? You want to give away our merchandise,
just like that?<wait>

[0026]
Well, yes! Friends help friends! <playername> just
moved here, you know. It's only right that we help
as we can.<wait>

Karen has a point, dear. How about you step up and show
how generous you can be for once, hmm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0028]
W-Well, ah... When you put it that way... I guess I could
hand out a free sample or two.<wait>

[0029]
Thanks, Dad! ♪<wait>

[0030]
Now there's that darling husband of mine.
I knew I married you for good reason.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0031]
O-Oh, quit it, both of you.
You're making me blush.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0032]
Here you go. They're on the house, so don't worry about
the tab.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0033]
We hope to see you at our General Store again soon.
Good luck with your farm. We'll be rooting for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0034]
Oh? I guess you have a firmer grip on farming than
I thought. All right, then.<wait><page>
If there's anything I can do to help, let me know, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0035]
Raising crops, caring for livestock... It's a costly
profession, I'll say that much. Good luck out there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0036]
If you have any questions about seeds or farming tools,
you can ask my dad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0037]
Good luck with your farm, dear. Swing on by and see me
if you ever need advice or someone to vent to.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0038]
Now, now, you two. Why don't you both take a deep
breath? If any customers saw you like this, they'd run
in terror.<wait>

Shush, Dad! What, don't tell me you're taking Mom's side
on this!<wait>

Be still, my raging daughter. You don't have to be so
prickly about it-- Oooh, ow. Now my ulcer's acting up...<wait>

[0043]
Ow. Ow ow ow. My ulcer.<wait>

[0044]
Hm? Oh! It's you, <playername>.<wait>

[0045]
<playername>. Welcome. All right, you two.
We have a customer. How about you
set that topic aside for a moment?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0046]
No, I think this is our chance to get the opinion of an
impartial observer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0047]
Good point, Mom. <playername> is the perfect person
to ask. <playername>, do you have a minute?<wait>

[0051]
See, one of my relatives has a child who was just
admitted to the hospital.<wait>

[0052]
We both agreed it would be a sweet gesture to send over
some flower seeds as a get-well-soon gift.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0053]
I think the OBVIOUS choice is to send Moondrop Flower
Seeds, but Mom is being stubborn about it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0054]
Heavens no, child. Moondrop Flowers are completely out
of the question. Pink Cat Flower Seeds are the superior
option.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0055]
So, yeah. They've both spent the day clashing over
something that really doesn't matter either way...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0056]
This is where you come in, <playername>.<wait>

Yes. Let's settle it this way, shall we? Whichever one
<playername> picks is the one we send. No hard
feelings.<wait>

Good grief...really? Ah well. If it means you'll finally stop
bickering, I guess it's fine.<wait>

Good! Then let's go with that.<wait>

Now, now. We agreed there would be no hard feelings.
The decision is made, so you'll have to suck it up, dear.<wait>

Well...the argument is over, at least. But Karen can get

so excited that you drop it on your way home, okay?<wait>

THAT'S what's irresponsible! Right now, the most
important thing he could do is be here to support Mom!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0369]
Listen to this, sweetie. Popuri and Rick are having a
nasty little argument over my husband.<wait><page>
They won't listen to a word I say. Could you talk to them,
please? Maybe they will listen to you, if not to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0370]
I think Popuri's right.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0371]
I think Rick's right.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0372]
You two are upsetting Lillia.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0373]
There, see? Even <playername> says I'm right.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0374]
<playername>! Could you kindly NOT butt into our
private family business? It's rude.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0375]
Just because <playername> agrees that you're
WRONG doesn't mean you get to be snippy, Rick!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0376]
Ugh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0377]
<playername>! Could you kindly NOT butt into our
private family business? It's rude.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0378]
<playername>, thanks for taking my side. I was really
happy when you said you agreed with me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0379]
Oh, good. They finally stopped arguing. Thank you, sweetie.
I appreciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0380]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0381]
Oh, good. They finally stopped arguing. Thank you, sweetie.
I appreciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0382]
WHAT?! But...But WHY?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0383]
There, see? Even <playername> agrees
that what Dad did was wrong.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0384]
Mrrrgh! <playername>, I can't believe you!
I thought you were nicer than that!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0385]
Hey now, Popuri. Don't say mean things about
<playername> just because you're wrong.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0386]
There, see? Even <playername> agrees that what
Dad did was wrong.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Hey now, Popuri. Don't say mean things about
<playername> just because you're wrong.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0388]
Don't you lecture me, Rick! You don't get it!
You don't get anything!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0389]
Oh, good gracious... Now they're arguing over you instead
of my husband.<wait><page>
How much longer will you two fight? Brothers and
sisters ought to be much nicer to each other. Please?
For Mom?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0390]
Oh, good gracious... Now they're arguing over you instead

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0391]
...Oh. Mama, I'm sorry for upsetting you. I didn't mean to.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0392]
Yeah. Sorry, Mom. Talking about Dad is a hot-button
topic for me, I guess...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0393]
Phew. You finally stopped arguing. What a relief.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0394]
Now, Popuri. Rick. Please stop arguing about your father.
It isn't his fault. All of this is my fault for being ill.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0395]
No, Mama! You can't blame yourself!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0396]
Yeah. You didn't do anything wrong, Mom. And, uh... Yeah.
I'm sorry I called Dad stupid.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0397]
It's all right, sweetie. I know you're just concerned about
your family's well-being.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0398]
This isn't any of your business. How can you pretend to
know anything?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0399]
I'm glad you could see it my way. Sorry to drag you into
our family business.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0400]
Sorry to drag you into our family business. I'll try not to
worry about Dad too much anymore.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0401]
<playername>, thanks for taking my side.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0402]
Hmph! If you're just gonna side with Rick, then I don't like
you anymore!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0403]
I'm sorry for putting you through all this,
<playername>. It must have been quite a headache.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0404]
I've got some apologizing to do. But don't worry.
It'll be okay now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0405]
<playername>, thank you so much for getting them
to stop fighting. You're a peach.<wait>

Dear, dear! My, my! I'm glad my two babies have so much
energy, but I do wish they'd stop quarrelling so much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0408]
Okay, I don't think anyone will disturb us here. Boy, you
sure surprised me, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0409]
So, um... Could you please say what you said again?
From the beginning?<wait><page>
Once I really take it in, I should be able to give you
a proper answer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0410]
<playername>...
Of course my answer is yes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0411]
Yay, yay, yay! This is so amazing! I'm a bouquet
of happiness right now!<wait><page>
Ever since we started dating, spending time with you
has been even more fun than it was before.<wait><page>
I was wishing that it could just go on and on forever...

Anyway, I'll be back soon! <wait>

Really? Thanks! I'll work even harder than I ever have.
That's a promise!<wait>

Oh, I've got an idea. Today, the food is on the house!
No better way to make you a customer for life!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0458]
Is that all right, Dad?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0459]
That's my smart girl. We might just have a new regular
on our hands after this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0460]
Well, you heard her.
Today's my treat, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0461]

I knew you'd say that! All right, Dad.
Go fix up something tasty.<wait>

You got it! Consider your taste buds preemptively
blown away. Wait just a sec.<wait>

Dad's food is amazing.
You're in for a real treat.<wait>

were chowing down was a reward in and of itself!<wait>

Yeah. Seeing people enjoy my food is what makes it all
worth it. I like you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Hey, now. No need to thank us. Just keep coming back
to our inn. Deal? I'm always here doing one odd job
or another.<wait>

you have a spare moment, would you?<wait>

Ugh, Dad. Quit it.<wait>

Hey, you don't have to be so polite, you know.<wait>

Huh... I guess some people really are like that.
Then we won't force you.<wait>

illness, is it?<wait>

Now, now. Calm down, you two. She is free of illness,
and that's what's most important here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0540]
Yeah, I guess so. But here I was, making such a huge fuss
over her, when all she did was overeat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

I don't even know what to say.<wait>

See how much you made Dudley worry, Ran? You must be

Yeah, okaaay. I'll be careful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0544]

Well, I'm gonna get back to work. See you,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0556]
Well, I'm gonna get back to work. See you,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0557]
Oh, <playername>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0558]
Perfect timing. There's something I need to talk
to you about.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0559]
It's about Ran. She's been through a lot, you know.<wait><page>
I raised her by myself after her mother died, which might
sound impressive to an outside observer, but...<wait><page>
To be honest, I've only made it this far because she's so
levelheaded.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0560]
I want her to find a good partner and be happy. To make
up for all the hardship she's endured, you know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0561]
But she's never once mentioned anything about love.<wait><page>
Except recently, you're all she talks about.<wait><page>
With that being said, I've got a question for you. How do
YOU feel about Ran?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0562]
She's found her way "inn" to my heart.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0563]
Uh... We're friends?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0564]
That so? Oh, that's a relief to hear!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0565]
Oh, <playername>. Welcome!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0566]
Ran, go stand next to <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0567]
Uh, sure, but...why?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0568]
Reason doesn't matter. Just do it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0569]
Oh, <playername>. Welcome!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0570]
Ahem. Ran, how do you feel about <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0571]
Uh... What kinda question is that?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0572]
I-It's none of your business!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0573]
It most definitely IS my business. I have more than enough
reason to ask. You're my one and only daughter!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0574]
Agh...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0575]
Ha ha ha ha ha! What're you so embarrassed for?
You're not a kid anymore!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0576]
Hey, you're all red too!<wait><page>
Well, anyway...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0577]
O-Oh, yeah? She's a good girl, if I do say so myself. Even if
I AM a bit biased. And you two seem to get along so well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0578]
Oh, <playername>. Welcome!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0579]
H-Hey, Ran. Are you done cleaning the second floor?
You didn't just hear all that, did you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0580]
Yeah, I'm done. And hear all what? What were you
talking about?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0581]
Oh, no, nothing, really. Aha ha ha...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0582]
Sheesh, Dad! Quit roping <playername> into your
little schemes!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0583]
Sheesh, Dad! Quit roping <playername> into your
little schemes!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0584]
Who's scheming? You're my one and only daughter, aren't
you?! I can't pretend like you're not precious to me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0585]
Agh...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0586]
*sigh* Sorry, <playername>. My dad can be kinda
forceful sometimes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0587]
*sigh* Sorry, <playername>. My dad can be kinda
forceful sometimes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0588]
*sigh* Sorry, <playername>.<wait><page>
I don't know what you were talking about, but if I know
my dad, I have an inkling...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0589]
*sigh* Sorry, <playername>.<wait><page>
I don't know what you were talking about, but if I know
my dad, I have an inkling...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0590]
A while back, I started chatting with a guest who came
to the Inn, and Dad asked them how they felt about me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0591]
He's so blunt. The guest was really taken aback and
stopped coming to the Inn.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0592]
Talk about tactless.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0593]
He's a good father.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0594]
Ha ha, seriously. But I only chatted with that guest
because they had such interesting stories to tell.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0595]
I know he's just worried about me, but he should let me
handle that stuff and just worry about himself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0596]
Once I've cooled off a bit, I'll go back to work. I'm gonna
rake him over the coals later, trust me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0597]
Yeah. I know he's trying to love me enough for Mom's
sake, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0598]
But sometimes, he goes overboard, and I get SO fed up
with him. Like today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0599]
Well, I'll get back to work in a few. I'm gonna rake him
over the coals later, trust me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0600]
Hey, <playername>. How was Ran?<wait><page>
Well, uh... No matter how you feel about Ran,
I'm glad she's got a friend like you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0601]
I leave Ran to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0602]
What is it? You here for some food?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0603]
No one's scheduled to come here today, right?
W-We can talk in private here, yeah?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0604]
Back to what we were talking about earlier...
Um... C-Can I clear something up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0605]
<playername>...are you sure? Are you sure you're
all right with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0606]
<playername>...are you sure? Are you sure you're
all right with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0607]
Aaah! I'm happier than a freshly waxed floor!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0608]
I've been dreaming of this day ever since we
started going out.<wait><page>
You've become so important to me, <playername>.
I get depressed on days when I don't see you.<wait><page>
So...to say I'm on cloud nine would be the
understatement of the century! ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

[0610]
I have to go tell Dad!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0611]
I see! So you've decided to be with <playername>!<wait><page>
Of course you have my blessing, Ran!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0612]
Thanks, Dad!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0613]
I'm sure your mother in heaven also agrees that
<playername> is the only one who's right for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0614]
Yeah. I know that's what Mom would say if she
were here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0615]
In that case, we've gotta get ready for the wedding.
It's the first day of your new life, so a big party's in
order.<wait><page>
I've gotta get a move on. First I'll tell the mayor, then
contact the venue and townspeople, and what else...?<wait>

[0617]
Dad, you're busy with the Inn. You don't have to put so
much effort into our ceremony.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0618]
Don't be ridiculous, Ran. This is for you and my new son.
I've gotta go all out.<wait><page>
The ceremony will be in about a week. Start getting
excited now!<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0620]
Oh, Dad... Yeah, you're right. Well, I'll leave it to you, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0621]
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
<playername> and Ran joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0623]
<playername>. Ran. Do you both hereby swear
to take each other as your sole partner for the rest
of your lives...<wait><page>
...To have and to hold, to respect and to cherish,
your hearts united no matter what may come?
For now, and forever?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0624]
Ran! <playername>! Congratulations! May you build
a happy family together!<wait><page>
Your happiness is my happiness. Don't you ever
forget that!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0625]
<playername>, now we'll be together forever.
I love you. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0626]
<playername>, now we'll be together forever.
I love you. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0627]
Phew, we're home! After the ceremony was pictures,
and then the reception party... It was all a blast!<wait><page>
Thanks to Dad and everyone's help, this day'll be one
to remember forever.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0628]
It was wonderful to celebrate with everyone,
but now we're finally alone together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0630]
Oh, that reminds me! I've been thinking...<wait><page>
Now that we're living together, it'd be nice to call each
other by our own special names.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0631]
So, whaddaya think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0632]
Okay, I'll call you that!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0633]
You want some other name, huh? What sounds good, then?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0634]
You got it. I'll call you <nickname> from now on! ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0635]
Oh, and I have another important thing I've gotta discuss
with you.<wait><page>
I want to keep helping Dad at the Inn.
Would that be okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0636]
Yeah, okay. Let's work together as partners!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0637]
All right, <nickname>. ∀ Our new life together
starts tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0638]
All right, <nickname>. ∀ Our new life together
starts tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0639]
Hmmm... What should I do?<wait><page>
Oh, maybe if I...
No, that won't work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0640]
Eek!<wait><page>
Oh, I'm so sorry. I was completely lost in thought.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0641]
Huh? I haven't seen you before. Are you here to sightsee?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0642]
Ooh! You're the one who's staying at that farm!<wait><page>
My name is Marie. It's nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0643]
Oh, <playername>. It's good to see you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0644]
It's awfully nice of you to drop by. Patrons at this library
are few and far between.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0645]
Forgive me for earlier. When I'm deep in thought,
I don't see what's around me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0646]
Is something troubling you?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0647]
You should be more careful.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0648]
No, that's not it. I'm writing my own novel, but I'm at
something of an impasse, so I'm trying to work it out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0649]
Thanks for your concern.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0650]
Please stop by whenever you're in the literary mood.
I'm sure we have plenty of books that can help
or inspire you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0651]
I truly do apologize. I'll be more attentive from now on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0652]
Feel free to read any book that catches your eye.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0653]
This isn't it. Not this one, either... Talk about odd.
Where did it go?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0654]
Oh, my! What a surprise. Please try not to scare me
like that, <playername>.<wait><page>
Hm? You want to know what I was doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0655]
Welcome. Did you come to read some books? Hm?<wait><page>
You want to know what I was doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0656]
Well, in truth, I'm writing a novel right now, and there's
a book somewhere in here I'd like to use as a reference.<wait><page>
I think it's here on the first floor, but...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0657]
Oh, I know, <playername>! I'm terribly sorry,
but would you be willing to help me look for it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0658]
Consider that book bound! Er, found!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0659]
No can do. Sorry.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0660]
Truly?<wait><page>
Okay, the book I'm looking for is...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0661]
I'm grateful for your help. Why don't you start
over there?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0662]
Hmmm... It's not here.<wait><page>
Do you see it over there, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0663]
I see. Would you keep looking, then?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0664]
Yes, that's it! So THAT'S where it was.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0665]
Perfect. Now I can keep writing my novel. Thank you so
much, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0666]
Oh, of course. I apologize for making such a shameless
request.<wait><page>
I'll look for it myself. See you, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0667]
My day just improved tenfold. Now I can keep writing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0668]
Where could it have gone? I can't write without it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0669]
*sigh*... *sniffle*
What a great story. *sob*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0670]
Oh... *sniffle* <playername>...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0671]
Did someone make me cry, you ask?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0672]
No, no. While I was organizing the Library, I came across
a certain book.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0673]
I thought I might give it a read somewhere with a great
view, so I brought it here.<wait><page>
The story was so magnificent that I was moved to tears.
Books are powerful like that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0674]
Thank you for your concern.<wait><page>
Has a book ever made you cry, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0675]
Yeah. Books are love. Books are life.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0676]
Mere words cannot move me.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0677]
Being able to get so wrapped up in a book is sort
of magical, don't you think?<wait><page>
Oh, here's a thought. I'll give this book to you,
<playername>.<wait><page>
Maybe try giving it a read? Only if it looks interesting
to you, of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0678]
You're welcome to it, really. I've already finished
reading it.<wait><page>
And besides, if I can, I'd like to share this feeling
with you.<wait><page>
If you can be so moved over a book, I think it will find the
perfect home with you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0679]
If you can be so moved over a book, I think it will find the
perfect home with you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0680]
Great. So you'll take it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0681]
All right, I'm heading back. Take good care of that book,
won't you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0682]
Oh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0683]
So you haven't come across a book that's been able to
move you yet.<wait><page>
I hope you find one eventually. I'm sure it's out there
somewhere.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0684]
Well, I have to be getting back. See you,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0685]
This is a problem.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0686]
Yes, it truly is.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0687]
Hey, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0688]
Hey, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0689]
Hello, <playername>.<wait><page>
If you've come to see Marie, you had best give up on that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0690]
I'm not entirely sure what the problem is, but Marie's in
an extremely foul mood right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0691]
It's true. She refuses to speak to anyone. All she's done is
sulk in silence.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0692]
I suppose she IS at that age.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0693]
Maybe she'd be willing to speak with someone who's
closer to her age?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0694]
I've got it! <playername>!<wait><page>
Could you find some way to ask her what's bothering her?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0695]
I've got it! <playername>!<wait><page>
Could you find some way to ask her what's bothering her?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0696]
You're just about the only person we can ask to do this.
So, please. Would you help?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0697]
*sigh* That's a relief.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0698]
We're counting on you. Go on up to the second floor.
That's where Marie is.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0699]
...Huh? Is that what my parents told you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0700]
I'm so sorry for getting you wrapped up in this. I'm not in
a bad mood at all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0701]
I should explain it to them too, so let's go downstairs.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0702]
I'm telling you, you've misunderstood. I was simply
pondering the theme for my next novel.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0703]
Oh, was that all? I was all but certain we did something
to upset you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0704]
I'm sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0705]
It's fine. More importantly, have you decided on
a theme yet?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0706]
Well... No, not yet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0707]
Hmmm... Do you have any good ideas, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0708]
I'm drawing a blank.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0709]
What about...farm work?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0710]
What about...Basil's work?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0711]
Don't worry about it. It's difficult to answer such
a random question, I'm sure.<wait><page>
I'll think it over a little more.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0712]
Eureka! That's it! Why did I not think of that before?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0713]
Oh, that's perfect. And you have a professional here
to consult.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0714]
That's a great idea.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0715]
Hey, I'd like to ask you a few things.
Are you free right now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0716]
Right. Now, please teach me everything you know. First...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0717]
...<wait><page>
Hmmm. Okay, I think that's it. Thank you for answering
my questions.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0718]
Oh, it's so late. Sorry for keeping you this long.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0719]
But now I'm inspired to write a truly great novel.
I'll work extra hard to pay you back for all your help.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0720]
Oh! My work, you say? What do you think, Marie?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0721]
Hmmm...<wait><page>
No, that's not very inspiring. I'm sorry to reject your idea
after you went to all the trouble to help.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0722]
Oh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0723]
I'll think it over a little more. A good idea might come to
me eventually.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0724]
Ummm... I think here should be okay. Let's continue our
previous discussion.<wait><page>
<playername>, are you serious? I'll be hurt if you're
playing a prank on me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0725]
Yes. I've read about marriage in so many books, and I've
always dreamed of experiencing it myself.<wait><page>
But I never would have believed it could happen to me
someday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0726]
Yes. I've read about marriage in so many books, and I've
always dreamed of experiencing it myself.<wait><page>
But I never would have believed it could happen to me
someday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0727]
Thank you. I couldn't be happier. Of course my reply
is a resounding yes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0728]
Yes. I love you, <playername>.
I hope you'll stay with me forever.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0729]
Yes. I love you, <playername>.
I hope you'll stay with me forever.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0730]
Now, I need to go tell my parents.<wait><page>
I'm sure they'll be shocked.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0731]
So, you've finally decided.<wait><page>
I'm so happy for you, Marie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0732]
You've always been so meek that it's hard to imagine you
leaving the nest.<wait><page>
I'm getting emotional. It seems like only yesterday that
you were in diapers...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0733]
Don't be ridiculous, Papa.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0734]
No, no, I'm just kidding. But time really does fly by,
doesn't it?<wait><page>
You find someone you love, and before you know it,
you're getting married.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0735]
No, no, I'm just kidding. But time really does fly by,
doesn't it?<wait><page>
You find someone you love, and before you know it,
you're getting married.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0736]
Yes, children have a way of growing up right before your
very eyes.<wait><page>
All we can do as parents is see you off with a smile.<wait><page>
Be happy, Marie.
And take good care of her, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0737]
Papa... Mama... Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0738]
Leave the wedding preparations to us.<wait><page>
We'll speak with Thomas, reserve the venue, and contact
the townspeople.<wait><page>
The ceremony will be... Hmmm... Given all the preparations
that need to be made, it will probably be in about a week.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0739]
Okay. I'll let you two handle it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0740]
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
<playername> and Marie joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.<wait>

[0741]
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see
<playername> and Marie joined in matrimony.
Let us begin.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0742]
<playername>. Marie. Do you both hereby swear
to take each other as your sole partner for the rest
of your lives...<wait><page>
...To have and to hold, to respect and to cherish,
your hearts united no matter what may come?
For now, and forever?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0743]
Marie, you're so beautiful. Please don't forget to come
see us at least once a week!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0744]
Your smiles make my heart sing. <playername>, she's
our one and only daughter, so please make her happy!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0745]
<playername>, now we'll be together for the rest of
our lives. I love you. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0746]
<playername>, now we'll be together for the rest of
our lives. I love you. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0747]
Today was like a dream.<wait><page>
There's no greater joy than feeling so loved and
supported by everyone we know.<wait><page>
And my parents were delighted, too. I held it back for so
long, but once I saw them, I couldn't stop the tears.<wait><page>
I'll be living here from now on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0748]
Oh, that's right.<wait><page>
I've been calling you <playername> until now, but...<wait><page>
I was thinking that maybe I should call you something else.
But what, exactly?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0749]
Yes, I like that.
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0750]
A different name would be better, right?
What would you prefer?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0751]
Our new life starts tomorrow, <nickname>. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0752]
Yes. I like that.
Our new life starts tomorrow, <nickname>. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0753]
Oh, before I forget: I want to keep working at the
Library as I have been. Is that all right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0754]
I've got something amazing to show you, Elly!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0755]
You do, do you? Well, don't keep me in suspense!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0756]
Get a load of THIS!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0757]
Oh, for goodness' sake! How many times have I told you
that this is a sterile environment?! That means no bugs!
Ever!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0758]
Heh heh heh. If you keep scowling, you're gonna
turn into a wrinkled old lady!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0759]
Wh-What did you just...?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0760]
And where do you think you're going, for that matter?!
Get back here this instant!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0761]
Oh! You're not from this town, are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0762]
I'm so sorry about all this. You're <playername>,
the one who came to work on the farm, right?<wait><page>
The whole town has been abuzz ever since your arrival.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0763]
I'm so sorry about all this. You're <playername>,
the one who came to work on the farm, right?<wait><page>
The whole town has been abuzz ever since your arrival.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0764]
My name is Elly. I'm the nurse at this Clinic.
It's a pleasure to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0765]
Oh, <playername>.
Have you come for a check-up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0766]
Oh, <playername>.
Have you come for a check-up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0767]
Is that so?<wait><page>
You should make a habit of seeing the doctor
on a regular basis. It's important to establish
a good self-care regimen.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0768]
And speaking of "seeing"...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0769]
Stop hiding behind <playername> and look me
in the eye, Yu!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0770]
Stop hiding behind <playername> and look me
in the eye, Yu!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0771]
Fine, you meanie!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0772]
Ugh... He's a natural-born prankster, I swear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0773]
All I did was show you a bug.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0774]
You know I hate insects.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0775]
That's why I keep bringing 'em to you.
It's so you'll get over it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0776]
*sigh* You always have a comeback for everything.
Who did you learn that from, I wonder?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0777]
You understand how I feel, don'tcha?
Being a guy and all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0778]
You understand how I feel, don'tcha?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0779]
Yeah, totally. What's bugging her?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0780]
You shouldn't harass people.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0781]
I knew you would. You 'n me are gonna be best buds!
I can tell!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0782]
Honestly, Yu...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0783]
Please don't encourage him, <playername>.<wait><page>
He'll only use it as an excuse to wreak more havoc.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0784]
Please don't encourage him, <playername>.<wait><page>
He'll only use it as an excuse to wreak more havoc.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0785]
...<wait><page>
Waaaaah!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0786]
Thank you for scolding him. And don't worry--those
were crocodile tears, I assure you.<wait><page>
He's not used to being reprimanded by people other
than me, that's all.<wait><page>
I hope it will make him think twice the next time
he's about to pull some of his usual antics.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0787]
I understand how Yu feels.<wait><page>
Children want attention, so they purposefully play tricks
on people they like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0788]
I'm sick and tired of his nonsense.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0789]
What's the matter, <playername>?
Are you feeling unwell?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0790]
What's the matter, <playername>?
Are you feeling unwell?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0791]
Hm? You...simply came to see me, you say?<wait><page>
Oh, <playername>. You're awfully kind.<wait><page>
We don't have any patients at the moment, so I can chat
for a little while.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0793]
Owww...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0794]
Jeff! What happened?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0795]
Owww...
Could you call the doctor?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0796]
Y-Yes, of course!<wait><page>
D-Doctor! Doctor, come quickly!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0797]
Doctor, here's Jeff's medicine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0798]
Right. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0799]
Hold on now, Elly. This isn't what I prescribed!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0800]
Oh! You're right.<wait><page>
I-I'm so sorry. I'll go get the correct medicine right away!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0801]
W-Will I be okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0802]
I can't apologize enough, Doctor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0803]
I noticed the mix-up before I gave it to him, so everything
is all right. Just be careful from now on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0804]
Now, be sure to take this every day. Don't miss a dose.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0805]
Appreciate it, Doctor. If we're done here,
then I'd better get back to the store.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0806]
*sigh* To think I made the same error once again...
I'm mortified.<wait><page>
I truly am useless. Am I even fit to be a nurse?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0807]
Don't let one mistake hold you back.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0808]
...
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0809]
You're right, <playername>.<wait><page>
If I stumble once and give up without a fight, then I'll
never get anywhere.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0810]
You're right, <playername>.<wait><page>
If I stumble once and give up without a fight, then I'll
never get anywhere.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0811]
What I need to do now is turn my mistakes into learning
opportunities so that I don't repeat them in the future.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0812]
I must make sure I never grab the wrong medicine again.<wait><page>
To that end, I will engrave today's encounter into my
heart so that I never jeopardize another patient's health.<wait><page>
Thank you for your encouragement, <playername>.
My outlook feels considerably brighter thanks to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0814]
Maybe this entire career path has been a waste of time...<wait><page>
I'm sorry to sour the mood, but I don't really feel like
talking to anyone right now.<wait><page>
We'll have to chat some other time.
I hope you can understand.<wait><page>
See you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0815]
Elly is a hard worker.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0816]
I must not grow complacent.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0817]
<playername>, it's good to see you.
<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0818]
Welcome...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0819]
Chin up, Elly, dear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0820]
Right...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0821]
She's a bit deflated at the moment, you see.
She made a meal for Yu, but...<wait><page>
...he took one bite of it, said he'd lost his appetite,
and ran outside.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0822]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0823]
My legs being what they are, I can't go out after him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0824]
Oh, I have a fabulous idea! Would you bring him back
for us, <playername>?<wait><page>
Knowing him, I'm certain he's hanging around
by the Church.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0825]
Refuse
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0826]
Accept
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0827]
It's all right. I wouldn't know a tablespoon of salt from
a cup of sugar, so it's no wonder he hated it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0828]
Oh, that is not true and you know it, dear. Yu will come
back before long.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0829]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0830]
*sniffle* I'm so sorry, Elly.<wait><page>
You made it just for me, but I told you I didn't want it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0831]
No, it's fine. I'm sorry too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0832]
Elly forgives you, so there's no need to cry anymore, Yu.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0833]
Okay. Sorry again, Big Sis.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0834]
Splendid! Then if you'll be so kind as to bring him
back for us...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0835]
Oh! Hey, mister.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0836]
Oh! Hey there, lady.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0837]
My sister's real sad? N-Now I feel bad.<wait><page>
But her cooking... No, never mind.<wait><page>
It's okay. I'll go back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0838]
I'm sorry for, uh...running away without saying anything,
Elly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0839]
No, it's fine. I shouldn't have tried to force you to eat it.<wait><page>
I'll practice more so I can make food that will really get
your tummy rumbling, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0840]
Yeah! Sounds good!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0841]
Phew. Thank goodness. I'm sorry for getting you wrapped
up in this, <playername>.<wait><page>
I'm fond of the rather...we'll say "straightforward"...food
Elly makes, so it hasn't bothered me, but...<wait><page>
From now on, I'll keep Yu's tastes in mind and give Elly
some cooking lessons.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0842]
Thanks, <playername>.
Oh, but before you go...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0843]
Thanks, <playername>.
Oh, but before you go...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0844]
By way of thanks, I'd like to give you these pressed
flowers I made a while back. Will you take them?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0845]
Good. I'm feeling better already.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0846]
Well, now that Yu has come home, I should get back in the
kitchen to practice my cooking.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0847]
Whaaat?! You're gonna make MORE food?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0848]
I'm glad Yu came back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0849]
Thanks, <playername>.
You're a peach.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0850]
I have to learn to make better food. Not just for my sake,
but for Yu's as well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0851]
I'm not going to mix up my salt and sugar today,
no matter what.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0852]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0853]
*sigh* I don't like what happens when Elly's
in the kitchen...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0854]
Oh, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0855]
Oh, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0856]
Hm? I don't seem like the beach-going type, you say?
Hee hee, I can't really argue with that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0857]
But when my parents were alive, we'd often come here
as a family.<wait><page>
I made a lot of fond memories with them here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0858]
When I'm sad or feeling introspective, this is my favorite
place to stop and reflect.<wait><page>
Somehow, I get the feeling that my parents can hear me
here, you know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0859]
I came today because I'm at something of a loss with Yu.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0860]
That boy loves making mischief. And he never listens
to a word I say.<wait><page>
For so many years now, I've tried to raise him right
in Mom's absence.<wait><page>
I do it because I don't want him to feel lonely or sad
with Mom gone.<wait><page>
But I'm wondering now if maybe I've been too soft on him.
If I'm to blame for his bad behavior.<wait><page>
What do you think, <playername>?
I want your honest opinion.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0862]
He's out of control.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0863]
A gentle approach is valid.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0864]
I thought you might say that. If other people view it that
way, then I really MUST be spoiling him.<wait><page>
*sigh* I've lost all confidence now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0865]
Well, I'm going to head back.
Thank you for listening to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0866]
I truly appreciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0867]
I agree. I might be biased, but he's really not
a bad kid at heart.<wait><page>
I'm sure he's just at that tender age.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0868]
I was at wits' end over this, but one word from you was
all it took for my confidence to come surging back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0869]
You're such an incredible person.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0870]

and play with Yu.<wait><page>
See you, <playername>.<wait>

No one will bother us here, so we can talk in peace.<wait><page>
Um... That wasn't a joke, was it?
You're serious about this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0874]
...Yes.
I know how you feel.<wait><page>
I can't claim to understand all the nuances of love, but...<wait><page>
I can say one thing with certainty: you're an extremely
special person to me.<wait><page>
So what I'm trying to say is...I feel the same way.
Thank you for putting it into words.<wait><page>
I want nothing more than to be your wife.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0875]
...Yes.

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0876]
Yes. Let's live together, supporting each other as only
a married couple can. I promise to put my best foot
forward.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0877]
I'm going to go home and tell my grandma right away.<wait><page>
I'm sure Yu will be pleased, as will my parents in heaven.
I have to formally announce our engagement to them.<wait><page>
See you, <playername>.<wait>

My, my. What an honor to bear witness to such a happy
occasion during my lifetime.<wait><page>
Congratulations, Elly.
And to you too, <playername>.
Take good care of our Elly, now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0880]
Are you gonna leave, Elly?
That makes me kinda sad...
It's gonna be lonely without you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0881]
Yeah, I know. I'd put my foot down if it was some weirdo,
but Elly'll be all right with you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0882]
Yeah, I know. I'd put my foot down if it was some weirdo,
but Elly'll be all right with you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0883]
Elly, you've spent all this time looking after me and Yu
without so much as a single complaint.<wait><page>
And that's why I want to make sure you're happier than
anyone else in the whole world.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0884]
Thank you, Grandma. I WILL be happy, so long as
I'm with <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0885]
Thank you, Grandma. I WILL be happy, so long as
I'm with <playername>.<wait>

[0886]
That's my girl.<wait><page>
Oh, right. I'll tell Thomas about the ceremony.<wait><page>
Usually, it takes about a week to get everything together,
if I recall.<wait><page>
I'm sure he'll do a fantastic job preparing the ceremony,
so don't you worry about a thing.<wait>

Oh yeah! "May you find happiness together!" ...Nailed it!<wait>

We're finally alone together.<wait><page>
Today was such a wonderful day. I feel so blessed by our
friends and neighbors.<wait><page>
My grandma was bawling. Did you see that?<wait><page>
Seeing her like that filled me with so many emotions all
at once.<wait><page>
That was when it hit me that I was truly getting
married.<wait>

Tomorrow marks the start of our new life together,

Of course the answer's yes! I can't tell you how happy

But if I catch you cheating on me, prepare yourself for
my wrath! Ha ha ha. I kid, I kid. I wouldn't do that to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0949]
I have a feeling this is gonna be even more fun than
cracking open a bottle of wine! ...Actually, can we do
both?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0950]
Anyway, I'd better head back. See you later, babe!<wait>

Welcome! Here for some shopping? Or could it be that
you just wanted to see li'l old me?<wait>

A little from column A, a little from column B, huh? Ha ha.
Geez, <playername>, you're such a flatterer.<wait>

through them as quickly as I can.<wait><page>
Both Mom and Dad are out today, and I have no idea
when they'll be back. Sorry, but can I take a rain check?<wait>

Yeah, there are a lot of them. And yeah, it's going to be
tough. But this is MY job, after all. Not yours.<wait>

[0965]
I'm your boyfriend. Let me help.

[0966]
I'm worried for you.

[0967]
I'm your girlfriend. Let me help.

card on me? In front of the booze and everyone?<wait>

Um?! G-Geez, did you really have to pull the "g-friend"
card on me? In front of the booze and everyone?<wait>

[0970]
Yeah. Okay. There are so many orders that if I tried to
do this myself, it could take all day.<wait><page>
And it's bad business to leave our customers waiting
forever for their orders, for that matter.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0971]
All right. Fine. You wore me down. I could use your help,
<playername>. If you don't mind, that is.<wait>

You're "worried for me"? What, do you think I'm not up
to the job or something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0974]
...No, you didn't mean it that way, did you? Yeah, I know.
You're just concerned for my well-being, that's all.<wait>

Okay. There are so many orders that if I tried to do this
myself, it could take all day. Plus, I'd wear myself out.<wait><page>

[0978]
Ah, there you are. I figured you oughta be gettin' here

Dad! Mom! Geez, you're finally back.
What took you so long?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0987]
We're sorry, dear. It took longer than we expected to
work out our shopping list and we lost track of time.<wait>

[0988]
Yeesh! I keep telling you to decide on what you want
BEFORE you go! Do you have any idea how much work
I had today?<wait><page>

Oh, nothing! ♪ We simply noticed you two happily
chatting away in front of the store as we were
walking up.<wait><page>
Part of me wonders if you wouldn't have preferred for
us to come home even later than we did.<wait>

Ohmigosh, you're sooo cuuute! ∀ Who's a little sweetie,
huh? Are you hungry?<wait>

Um...aha ha. Boy, what a coincidence, right? I was just, um...
Out for a walk! You too, I assume?<wait><page>
It's so nice in the woods that I just kinda wandered out
this way, and just so happened to find all these animals...<wait>

You're curious, aren't you? I can tell from the look on
your face. ...Promise you won't laugh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1011]
Most people in town think of me as the frank, down-to-
earth type, right? Heck, they aren't wrong, either.<wait><page>
I mean, I'm not a bubbly and super girly girl like, say,
Popuri.<wait><page>
And, well...I like it that way. I WANT people to think of
me as a mature and reliable older sister of sorts.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1012]
But when I see little animals, they're just so cute and
fuzzy that I can't help but want to give them ALL THE
SNUGGLES.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1013]
Having anyone else see me acting like that...hoo boy.
I'd never live it down.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1014]
You're too self-conscious.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1015]
Cutesy Karen is good. She can hang.

[1016]
Geez. Blunt much? Still, I like the image I present, and I'm
not exactly inclined to change it anytime soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1017]
So don't tell anyone what you saw. Please? Let's make it
our little secret.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1018]
I'm gonna have to be more careful in the future.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1019]
Maaan, isn't there anywhere I can cuddle all the cute
critters without having to worry about prying eyes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1020]
Urk! Y-You aren't disappointed? I haven't totally ruined
my image?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

"Cutesy Karen," huh? I'm glad you see it as just another
part of me, <playername>.<wait>

I panicked a little when you saw me, but if anyone had to
catch me red-handed, I'm glad it was you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1024]
Oh, wait! I know! If I go to your farm, there are all kinds
of cute animals I can cuddle and snuggle!<wait><page>
And if I'm inside the Barn, anybody who comes to your
farm won't even know I'm there! Holy animoly, I'm a
genius!<wait>

Anyway, it's probably time to head back. Mind if I drop by
your farm on the way?<wait>

[1029]
Boy, <playername>, talk about blunt! There's a
special mood you're supposed set up first, y'know!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1030]
I'd give that 60 points out of 100 on my satisfaction scale,
but y'know what? It was SO like you to do it that way.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Hee hee hee! Oh, I'm so happy! I didn't even dare dream

...You kept your schedule open for me, you say? Phew!
Thank goodness!<wait><page>
Okay, so, guess what? I was going to cook today, and I
thought it would be super fun if we could do it together!<wait><page>
See? I brought a whole bunch of the eggs our chickens
laid for us. ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1040]
Hm? Is it okay if we use them without asking first?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1041]
Yep, totally! See, I got these eggs as a reward for busting
my butt to make our chickens feel like poultry royalty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1042]
Aww, don't be a meanie! I tried really hard for you, too.
I'm hurt.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1043]
Forgive you? Hmm... I dunno. Maaaybe I will.
Maaaybe I won't.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1044]
Let's see... Today, I'm in the mood for omelet rice,
plus some cake for dessert.<wait><page>
Ooh! And can we make some pudding for Mama, too?<wait><page>
If you don't have a recipe, that's okay. I made sure to look
them up ahead of time! Oh, ME! I'm so reliable!<wait><page>
I have aaall the ingredients we'll need right here...
Even the ones that aren't eggs!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1045]
If you help me cook, I'll be nice and forgive you for earlier.
Well? Will you help?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1046]
Yaaay! <playername>, you're the best! ∀ Come on, let's
go to my place and get cracking! The eggs, I mean.<wait>

Okay! This is my chance to show off just how much of
a kitchen whiz I really am.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1048]
Oh, but I don't like handling sharp knives and stuff to chop
things. Would you do that part, please?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1049]
First things first, let's crack the eggs into this bowl
right here.<wait><page>
Next, we add a biiig splash of milk and mix it all together
reeeal good!<wait><page>
And theeeeen...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1050]
Eee! ∀ Look! It's on its way to being a culinary
masterpiece, isn't it?<wait><page>
Well, <playername>? Doesn't it look yummy?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1051]
It looks surprisingly decent.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1052]
Your technique is, uh...rustic.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1053]
You didn't need that "surprisingly" part, you know!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1054]
But, um, to be honest...I didn't think it would turn out this
well either.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1055]
Rick always says he can't trust me in the kitchen. All he
lets me do is set the table and carry out the food.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1056]
He does everything else all by himself. I know I can do
more if I try, but he treats me like I'm a little kid.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1057]
Today, however, proved that I CAN cook! I'm gonna show
off just how good it turned out to Rick and Mama!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1058]
Hee hee. I will say, having you there supervising things
gave me lots of extra confidence.<wait><page>
You didn't get mad or impatient with me, either.
I wouldn't have been able to do it without you. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1059]
Boy, time sure does fly when you're cracking eggs.
I really want to cook with you again sometime,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1060]
Don't forget about my present! I hope you really like the
pudding I made. It turned out great, in my humble opinion!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1061]
I'll see you later, then. Thanks again for helping me!<wait>

unreliable to you and Rick, but I...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1064]
...Actually, let's not take a trip to sadtown right now,
<playername>. We worked hard to cook this, so let's
eat!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1065]
Mmm! That was super yummy. Probably because you
were there to help me with it, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1066]
I'll see you later, then. Thanks for helping me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1067]
Ugh! Stupid Rick! You don't understand ANYTHING!
I hate you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1068]
Wah! <playername>?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1069]
O-Oh, um, it's nothing. Never mind. Say, can I bend your
ear for a minute?<wait><page>
I'd really appreciate if you could help me with a little
something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1070]
You're the best. Come on, it's this way.<wait>

[1071]
Hmmm. I think here is good. I should be able to find what
I'm looking for...I hope.<wait>

See, um, Mama hasn't been feeling so hot today. It's not
so serious that she needs to go to the Clinic...<wait><page>
But she doesn't have as much energy as usual, and she
couldn't finish her breakfast. I'm kinda worried.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1073]
That's why I decided to go pick some of her favorite
flowers and give her a biiig bouquet as a present!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1074]
It IS a great idea, isn't it? I knew you would agree with
me, <playername>. ♪<wait><page>
Will you help me find some extra-lovely flowers
for the bouquet?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1075]
Thanks, <playername>. Remember, only the best
of the best of the BEST will do for Mama's bouquet,
all right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1076]
Hmmm... I think a bigger flower would look really nice
with this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1077]
That flower is wonderfully colorful and pretty, don't you
think? I bet Mama will really like that one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Having a big variety of different flowers will make it
super bright and pretty, I'm sure!<wait>

over there are pretty?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1080]
No, the one to the left of that one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1081]
Whoops! I got them mixed up. To the right, to the right.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1082]
No, that's too far, <playername>! Come back this
way. Now go a little farther!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1083]
Huh? That's weird. This isn't the flower I thought it was.
Oopsie doodles!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1084]
Oh, look over there! THAT one! I'm sure THAT has to be
a really rare flower!<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1089]
I got so wrapped up in the flowers that I wasn't being
considerate, was I? I'm sorry.<wait><page>
When you agreed to help me, I got totally carried away in
my excitement. I hope you can forgive me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1090]
Um, Mama really IS feeling bad today, though. And Rick
HAS been extra-super busy with the store.<wait><page>
I said I wanted to help, but he totally ignored me and
continued working.<wait><page>
I want to help. I want to do things for my family.
But I keep getting treated like a kid. So I got mad
and left.<wait><page>
Then I ran into you, <playername>, and you were so
accommodating that I couldn't help myself.<wait><page>
I got super bossy and started demanding all sorts of
things from you as a way of lashing out about being
ignored.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1091]
You, um...you aren't mad at me, are you? You aren't upset
because I'm too bossy and demanding?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1092]
Thanks, <playername>. I feel better now that you
listened to me vent.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1093]
Hm? You say I could make a difference by doing simple
housework and cleaning? I...guess I could manage that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1094]
Y'know what, that's a good point. I can find ways to help
on my own and do them without being asked.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1095]
Just you watch, <playername>! I'm gonna bust my
butt and help my family like a...a super-helpful person!
Yeah!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1096]
Oh, and I should probably say sorry to Rick for yelling at
him, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1097]
Huh? <playername>, wait! Don't go!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1098]
Aww...too late. Though...I guess I WAS taking advantage
of the situation.<wait><page>
I got bossy and made all kinds of demands. That wasn't
right. I'm really sorry, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1099]
Okay, now that I've had a minute to come back down to
earth... Sure is hard to think when you're that surprised.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1100]
Can you repeat what you said before?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1101]
So I WASN'T dreaming! Well, sweep my floors and call
me spotless! Yippee!<wait><page>
Of COURSE I'll happily be your girlfriend. As long as you
don't feel like you're settling!<wait>

I can chew.<wait>

Oh, <playername>.
Wel...come. *sigh*<wait>

[1109]

[1110]
I sound as tired as I look, you say? Wow. That obvious,
huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1111]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1112]
So, what happened was, a guest who came to our inn
wound up getting their favorite outfit dirty.<wait><page>
So they were talking my ear off about how to take care
of a stain on white fabric.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1113]
If one of our guests left disappointed, then I'd be
disappointed too. I won't settle for less than total
satisfaction.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1114]
That's why I wanted to help them, but regular ol' soap
isn't up to snuff for the mega-stain I'm dealing with.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1115]
Let's find a stronger detergent.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1116]
Let's do something to cheer you up.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1117]
A stronger detergent, huh? Yeah, to be fair, having
something like than on hand DOES sound...well,
handy as heck.<wait><page>
I hope the General Store has it. Not that I remember
seeing anything like that the last time I was there...<wait><page>
Well, I'll never know if I don't check. Will you come with
me, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

[1119]
I can give you some regular soap, but we don't stock the
sort of detergent you're looking for.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1120]
Sorry, Ran. I wish I could help you, but I'm afraid our
stock says otherwise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1121]
Hey, don't worry about it. I just came to check on the off
chance that you might have it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1122]
At least you tried. Maybe you can find someone around
town who might know where to find something like that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1123]
An expert on all things immaculate, huh? Good idea!
I'll ask around!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1124]
Thanks so much for coming with me, <playername>.
I'll take it from here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1125]

Ah! Mei. When we were playin' in the mud, you got some
on your clothes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1134]
Whaaat?! You're right!
Awww, boo! This my favorite outfit!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1135]
Oh, you shouldn't rub mud stains like that. It'll only make
it harder to get off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1136]
Really? Then what do I gotta do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1137]
Uhhh... You gotta dry 'em first, then use a brush to get
the mud out. Yeah.<wait><page>
Then you kinda beat it with a damp towel.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1138]
Oh, wow!
You're so smart, Yu!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1139]
Heh heh, Grandma Ellen taught me.<wait>

My, my. So THAT'S why you came to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1143]
I've had to get quite a few stains out in my day, so
naturally, I have a trick or two. All you have to do is...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1144]
Okay, I get it. So that's how you...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1145]
Great! Sounds easy enough! Thank you so much, Ellen.
I'll go try this right away.<wait>

[1146]
You're a rock star, <playername>! It's all thanks to

Welcome to the Library, <playername>.
Did you come to peruse our collection?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1152]
Welcome to the Library, <playername>.
Did you come to peruse our collection?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1153]
By all means, we are at your disposal. In fact, Ran is here
today too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1154]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1155]
She's been coming to read at the Library frequently as
of late. We even chat on occasion.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1156]
...What do we chat about, you ask? If you're so curious,
you should ask her directly.<wait><page>
She went upstairs to look through the books on the
second floor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1157]
...Oooh, I see. Hmmm...
You learn something new every day.<wait><page>
Oh, that's the last page.
Better find another book.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1158]
<playername>!
How long've you been there?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1159]
<playername>!
How long've you been there?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1160]
Sorry, did you say something earlier? I was so absorbed in
that book, I totally didn't notice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1161]
So, are you looking for a certain book today,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1162]
So, are you looking for a certain book today,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1163]
Huh? You heard I was here and came just to see me?
Awww, you're so sweet!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1164]
Marie might've told you, but lately, I've been coming to
the Library whenever I have a little free time.<wait><page>
Remember how I was all worried about how to clean a
guest's clothes a while back?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1165]
Well, when I seized victory over that stain and gave the
guest's clothes back, they were thrilled. And so was I!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1166]
So I started wondering if there was anything else I could
do to make our guests happy.<wait><page>
And then it hit me that I could act as a tour guide, telling
them about good spots around town and local specialties.<wait><page>
That way, I can promote the town and make our guests
happy in one fell swoop! Two birds, one stone, no?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1167]
But when I started to mull over what to talk about,
I realized that I actually don't know that much about
this place.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1168]
That's why I started coming to the Library to brush up
on my expertise as a local!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1169]
Glad you "Ran" with this idea!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1170]
Wow, so you CAN read!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1171]
Hee hee...
Your support means a lot to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1172]
Up until now, I thought following in Dad's footsteps was
enough, and didn't ever question my path.<wait><page>
But after seeing how hard you work on that farm,

Do you have any recommendations, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1179]
Do you have any recommendations, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1180]
Huh, a study on which species of rare plants you can find
in this town?<wait><page>
These are edible plants?
And these ones are dangerous?
Wow. I had no idea.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1181]
Ugh... That's pretty harsh, but I can't even think of a good
comeback. You're way too blunt, <playername>.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1201]
And then I can recommend my favorite books to you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1202]
Well, you certainly couldn't have asked a better person.
Books are my specialty.<wait><page>
I'm so glad that we share a mutual interest in literature,
<playername>.<wait><page>
The Library is closed today, but I have the keys, so I can
open it for a little while. Let's get going, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1203]
Huh? Marie and <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1204]

Wow, so you're a bookworm too, huh, <playername>?
That's a bit of a surprise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1210]
Marie's my book advisor today.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1211]
Reading is the worst.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1212]
That's right. I'm going to pick out some books that I think
<playername> will like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1213]
Let me get this straight: you hate reading, but you're
going to the Library?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1214]
H-Huh? My plan today is to pick out some books that
I think <playername> will like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1215]
Huh. That sounds nice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1216]
Same! I don't read very much, so I don't know which books
are good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1217]
No need to worry. There's a book for every mood and
every interest. I'm sure I can find some that you two
will like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1218]
You think there's a book that's up my alley, even?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1219]
Hmmm... What about an adventure book that helps expand
your cooking capabilities at the same time?<wait><page>
Gourmand General is a book about a general who
secretly travels the country searching for the ultimate
ingredient.<wait><page>
He encounters a wide variety of food on his journey, and
there are detailed recipes for all of them at the end.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1220]
Wow! That sounds really cool!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1221]
Yes, it's fascinating. And the writing utilizes the literary
device of poetic justice, making it an uplifting read.<wait><page>
His catchphrase is: "Can you keep your eyes on my knife?"
When his legendary kitchen knife flashes, villains fall.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1222]
Hey, what about me? Is there a book I'd like?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1223]
For you, Popuri...
How about My Uncle's a Wizard?<wait><page>
It's a love story about a simple girl who goes to the
castle ball and falls in love with the prince.<wait><page>
Her uncle's actually a wizard, and he uses his magic to
make beautiful clothes for his niece. It's a feel-good
story.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1224]
Wow, that sounds amazing!
I've gotta read that!<wait><page>
The Library has sooo many books that I didn't feel like
trying to comb through them before, but now...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1225]
Guess you just have to know where to look, huh? I might
enjoy reading if you pick out books for me, Marie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1226]
Right?<wait><page>
I'm always trying my hardest to get people who don't
read into the Library. So please, come borrow some
books.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1227]
Yeah, okay!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1228]
I'm on the hook for an errand for Lillia today, so I've
gotta get to Popuri's house now.<wait><page>
But I'll definitely come later to borrow that book you
just mentioned.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1229]
I wanna hear about more books too, so I'll come by the
Library sometime. ♪<wait><page>
See ya, Marie and <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1230]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1231]
It sounds like their interest was piqued by the books
I recommended.<wait><page>
I'm always so happy to hear that someone's taken
an interest in reading.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1232]
I'm sure it's all thanks to you, <playername>.<wait><page>
Ever since I got to know you, I feel like more and more
people have been coming to the Library.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1233]
And more people talk to me now, too.<wait><page>
They want me to recommend books, like today, or to find
books that will help them with their own hobbies or
research.<wait><page>
I think it's because I've become a little more personable
ever since I met you.<wait><page>
Maybe that's why the townspeople chat with me more
readily now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1234]
You've helped me grow and change.
Thanks, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1235]
Now, it's getting a little late, but let's head to the
Library.<wait><page>
I still haven't picked out any books for YOU to read,
and that's what I'm most looking forward to.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1236]
Oh, <playername>. I'm so pleased to see you, but...
We've already closed for the evening. My apologies.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1237]
I think I will take a stroll up the mountain.<wait><page>
Inspiration for my novels tends to strike most while I'm
out walking around.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1238]
Huh? You want to come with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1239]
Of course I'd welcome the company.
Let's take a stroll together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1240]
Aaah. This is refreshing. Coming here always stokes the
fires of my imagination.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1241]
And I'm using the summit here as inspiration for
my next story.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1242]
This time, I'm planning on writing a story that's a mix
between an old alpine myth and a romance novel.<wait><page>
It's a tragic love story between someone who becomes a
cursed werewolf and the mountain goddess.<wait><page>
The werewolf doesn't age because of the curse, and one
day meets the mountain goddess and falls in love.<wait><page>
But the goddess knows how fervently the werewolf
wants to be human again, and so she grants their wish.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1243]
The werewolf becomes human again, but can no longer
see their beloved mountain goddess now that the curse
is gone.<wait><page>
They learn that losses and gains both come
at a heavy price.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1244]
And so the human sets off once more on the path of
mortality, conflict brewing in their heart. That's how it
ends.<wait><page>
What do you think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1245]
Exciting AND inspiring!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1246]
That's pretty grim, Marie.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1247]
Th-Thanks. It's pretty embarrassing to talk about it
when I haven't finished it yet.<wait><page>
But your encouragement has renewed my motivation.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1248]
I-I suppose it is rather esoteric.<wait><page>
But...I would like it to reach a wide audience, so...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1249]
I value your feedback, so I'll try revising it to make
it simpler.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1250]
You're my light, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1251]
A world without you is a world shrouded in darkness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1252]
But your happiness is paramount.
If you're happy, then I'll be happy.<wait><page>
Because...I love you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1253]
Hmmm... But when you're trying to confess your feelings
to someone...<wait><page>
Writing "I love you" is a little cliched, isn't it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1254]
Oh! What is it, <playername>?
Wait... Oh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1255]
U-Um... Did I just...say all of those sappy lines out loud?
How mortifying.<wait><page>
No, no! I was just thinking about how I should end
my novel. Um... I'm sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1256]
I was thinking... I want to give them a happy ending now.<wait><page>
I mean, it would be like me never being able to see you
again for the rest of my life. I couldn't bear that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1257]
I feel like it would be inauthentic to write a story
of doomed romance when I'm this happy.
I'm with you, after all.<wait><page>
Thank you for helping me write our own story
of companionship, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1258]
Goodness, <playername>.
You brought it up so suddenly that I didn't know what
to do with myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1259]
Goodness, <playername>.
You brought it up so suddenly that I didn't know what
to do with myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1260]
Will you say it just one more time?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1261]
Yes...<wait><page>
I've been so preoccupied with my family that I dared not
even dream of having a boyfriend.<wait><page>
I don't know what to do. I'm beside myself with happiness,
truly.<wait><page>
If you'll have me, then I am yours. I accept,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1262]
Yes...<wait><page>
I've been so preoccupied with my family that I dared not
even dream of having a girlfriend.<wait><page>
I don't know what to do. I'm beside myself with happiness,
truly.<wait><page>
If you'll have me, then I am yours. I accept,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1263]
So from now on, we're dating.<wait><page>
I feel like I have butterflies in my stomach. Deep breaths,
Elly, deep breaths... I'm not dreaming, right?<wait><page>
I-In any case, I have work to finish yet, so I must be
getting back.<wait><page>
I can't wait until our first date, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1265]
Oh, <playername>.
Did you come to see me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1266]
Oh, <playername>.
Did you come to see me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1267]
You...want to go out somewhere?<wait><page>
Yes...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1268]
There's some time yet before supper, and it WOULD be
nice to engage in some self-care for a change.<wait><page>
Oh, but please wait a moment. I can't go out with my hair
looking like this.<wait><page>
Um, would you give me a little time to get myself ready?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1269]
I'll be right back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1270]
I'm sorry for the wait! All right, let's be off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1271]
Oh, hey, it's my sister.<wait><page>
Kinda weird for her to be outside this late.
What're those two up to?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1272]
Are you worried about her?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1273]
N-No... Nothing like that. I'm just kinda suspicious of what
they might be doing, that's all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1274]
Do you wanna spy on them? We'll have to be quiet so we
don't get found!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1275]
Okay!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1276]
They're...not doing anything.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1277]
No, hang on a sec.
I think they're playing together.<wait><page>
Kinda like you and me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1278]
Playing, huh?<wait><page>
It's kinda funky to think of my sister playing around.
She's a grown-up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1279]
You're the one who's weird for thinking that, Yu.<wait><page>
Elly's always busy with work and the house and stuff.
Of course she'd wanna hang out with her friend
sometimes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1280]
Huh... Guess you're right.
Elly usually doesn't have fun.<wait><page>
She's always makin' food for us, cleaning, doing laundry...
And then she works at the Clinic on top of it all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1281]
I guess that's why it feels weird to see her walkin'
around outside.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1282]
What's wrong, Yu?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1283]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1284]
I'm goin' home.
There's something I've gotta do.<wait><page>
See you tomorrow, Mei.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1285]
What's going on?
You're acting strange, Yu.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1286]
*sigh* It feels like it's been a lifetime since I've had
a nice, long chat like this.<wait><page>
Thanks, <playername>. I had a great time finally
being able to let my hair down a little.
Good thing I brushed it! ♪<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1288]
But I think I'd better be getting back home soon.
I still have to make supper.<wait><page>
And I'm worried that Yu might be bothering Grandma
with all his whining.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1289]
I'm sure he's on his best behavior.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1290]
Yeah, "Yu" had better rein him in.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1291]
I wonder... Well, if you say so, <playername>, I'll take
your word for it.<wait><page>
Let's get going.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1292]
I wonder... Well, if you say so, <playername>, I'll take

my worries aren't misplaced.<wait><page>
Well, then, let's hurry back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

[1295]
Welcome back, Elly!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1296]
Hi, Yu.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1297]
Um... This is for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1298]
Are these...chore coupons?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1299]
Yep.<wait><page>
If you ever wanna go out and have fun again...<wait><page>
...Then I'll help out around the house. That way you'll have
more time to play.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1300]
Yep.<wait><page>

[1301]
Oh, Yu...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1302]
What ever am I going to do with you?<wait><page>
Thank you, little brother.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1303]
Heh heh...
Okay, I'm gonna go home now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1304]
<playername>, I'm just...
I'm beaming right now. Can you tell?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1305]
<playername>, I'm just...
I'm beaming right now. Can you tell?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1306]
He noticed that I couldn't spend much time with you, so
he tried to help out in his own way. It's a lovely gift...<wait><page>
...But I'm not sure I can bring myself to use these coupons.
I want to keep them as a memento of his selflessness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

[1308]
Yes...<wait><page>
It seems that did the trick.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1309]
That's the first time I've seen Elly with such a happy look
on her face.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1310]
My, my. <playername>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1311]
Oh, <playername>.
We were just talking about you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1312]
Let me take this opportunity to thank you.<wait><page>
I'm so grateful to you for choosing Elly as your girlfriend.<wait><page>
All her time's been spent taking care of us, so she's never
had a chance to fall in love.<wait><page>
I've always regretted that.<wait><page>
I felt guilty that I was making her waste her most tender
years being a caretaker.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1314]
No, no. Elly adores you and Yu. She wouldn't consider
it a waste.<wait><page>
Though it was difficult watching her try so hard to be a
stand-in mother to Yu after their parents passed away.<wait><page>
To be honest, we were all secretly worried for her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1315]
But you know, <playername>...<wait><page>
She's changed so much ever since you came to town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1316]
Until now, she was always worried about Yu's mischief,
or her errors at work, or her clumsiness in the kitchen.<wait><page>
She'd mope around all day, lost in thought. She was
always so pessimistic.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1317]
But a while back, she was dashing to and fro, all atwitter
with excitement. So I asked her what was going on.<wait><page>
She said she needed to brush her hair because she had a
date with you, but she couldn't find her brush.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

I think that's the first time I've seen her look so
exhilarated.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1320]
I think that's the first time I've seen her look so
exhilarated.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1321]
And that's not all. She's always so animated whenever

I think you've been good for her spirit.<wait>

Yes. I think she's finally learned to take some time for
herself.<wait><page>
When she's at home, she only ever talks about you,
you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1324]
Right. And recently--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1325]
Oh, speak of the devil... Well, angel, really.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1326]
Oh, <playername>. Ahaha...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1327]
Oh, <playername>. Ahaha...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1328]
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1329]
It was just...a little hard to interject, considering the
topic of conversation.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1330]
I never knew that Grandma and Thomas were so worried
about me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1331]
But they're right.
I think I've changed a lot.<wait><page>
I was never interested in love before, and didn't really
care about how I presented myself to others.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1332]
But they're right.

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1333]
But now...I want to take care of myself, and not only so
that you'll be proud to have me standing at your side.<wait><page>
Whenever I think about you, my heart starts pounding.<wait><page>
And I can't stop thinking about what we should talk
about the next time I see you.<wait><page>
That anticipation, that excitement... It's given me
a renewed sense of purpose.<wait><page>
And I'm certain it's all thanks to you, <playername>.
Thank you for helping me change for the better.<wait>

No, thank YOU.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1336]
How thankful are you?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1337]
Hee hee! It's a little silly to be thanking each other
for being grateful.<wait><page>
But it's wonderful to have someone you can respect,
and who respects you in return.<wait><page>
I can't wait to spend more time with you,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1340]
Hee hee. Goodness, <playername>. You're so
calculating.<wait><page>
Still, I think we have a lot of happy times ahead,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1341]

[1342]
Hm? Oh. <playername>. Hello.<wait><page>
I was just opening my soul to the positive energies
of Mother Nature.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1343]
Hm? Oh. I don't believe we've met.<wait><page>
I'm Jennifer. It's a pleasure.<wait><page>
I was just opening my soul to the positive energies
of Mother Nature.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1344]
Can you feel them? They emanate in waves from the song
of the birds, from the light of the sun...<wait><page>
It's as if the world itself is blessing the advent
of a brand new day. Don't you agree?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1345]
Um, yeah, let's back it up a little.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1346]
Yeah, my chakras are totally aligned.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1347]
Ah, could it be that you're one of the many unfortunate
souls incapable of feeling the world's natural energies?<wait><page>
I had the impression that you were considerably more...
special than that. Ah, well. We all make mistakes.<wait><page>
Be seeing you, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1348]
And mine! I see you are someone who understands these
esoteric truths. Lovely.<wait><page>
When I bring up this subject, most people simply end
the conversation with a puzzled expression.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1349]
And mine! I see you are someone who understands these
esoteric truths. Lovely.<wait><page>
When I bring up this subject, most people simply end the
conversation with a puzzled expression.<wait><page>
By the by, who are you?<wait><page>
Aha. You're that farmer everyone speaks so highly of.
I'd been hoping to meet you someday.<wait><page>
To farm is to live in harmony with the earth and work
hand in hand with life itself. It fascinates me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1350]
I spend nights at the Inn, but the rest of the time,
you can generally find me here in my tent.<wait><page>
Come visit me again if your energies inspire you to.
There is much I want to ask you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1351]
Ah, yes. That works like this. You see, what happens is...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1352]
Aha, I see. Fascinating.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1353]
Oh. <playername>. Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1354]
Ah, good morning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1355]
What are we doing, you ask? Why, holding a meeting
between botanical aficionados.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1356]
Yes. We were just examining this flower.<wait><page>
We were noting what we observed and sharing our
thoughts with one another.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1357]
Now, I've devoted much of my life to botany, but
Jennifer's knowledge eclipses even mine.<wait><page>
She approaches botany with such a different point of
view that it brings my attention to things I never noticed.<wait><page>
Every now and again, we like to get together and
exchange notes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1358]
I must admit, I have little interest in fully exploring the
nuances of plant ecology...<wait><page>
But watching flowers bloom with the caress of the
morning sun is like communing with Mother Nature
Herself.<wait><page>
Even the gloomiest day becomes fulfilling and rewarding
after an encounter like that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1359]
Now, many flowers fold tightly into buds during the day,
yet open with the touch of the sun. Why do you think that
is?<wait><page>
PASSION!<wait><page>
The bees and insects that carry pollen are mostly active
in the morning, yes?<wait><page>
It is to entice those insects to them--to beguile them!--
that they unfurl their petals and release their sweet
scents.<wait><page>
If you listen carefully, you can almost hear the flowers
crying out, "Spread my love to the world!"<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1360]
Er, actually, that's triggered by a temperature shift.
Not passion. When the bud's internal temperature
changes...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1361]
Goodness, what a dry and lifeless answer. I do not mean
to deny the verity of science...<wait><page>
But to me, there is a romantic and spiritual aspect of
Mother Nature's workings that it fails to encapsulate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1362]
Different strokes, I guess.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1363]
Yeah! Flower power!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1364]
Yes, very true. I think Jennifer's way of thinking is
uniquely expressive and imaginative.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1365]
It is unfortunate that neither of you agree with my
interpretation, but ah well. Different strokes indeed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1366]
The people of this town are not quick to ostracize others
for holding differing points of view. I like that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1367]
Ahaha. Thank you. I think you and I will be like two peas in
a pod...or two buds on a branch, as it were.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1368]
True, true. Everyone has their own internal compass by
which they navigate the world on their own terms.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1369]
I think it's a good thing that there are so many different,
yet equally valid ways of viewing the world.<wait><page>
Whether you look at them scientifically or romantically,
both viewpoints stem from the same love of plants.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1370]
Oh, dear, would you look at the time? I really must be
getting home.<wait><page>
I think I've taken enough notes, so if you don't mind,
I'll excuse myself for today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1371]
Come to think of it, what brings you up the mountain this
early in the morning, <playername>?<wait><page>
Did you have some business up here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1372]
Hm? Your feet simply led you in this direction?<wait><page>
I see. The aura of the mountain must have drawn you in.<wait><page>
I KNEW there was some special energy to this mountain...
Something that tugs and pulls at the soul.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1373]
Ahaha. You know? I think our budding friendship may
blossom into something special.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1374]
Oh. <playername>. Hello.<wait><page>
You have perfect timing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1375]
Look at this lake.<wait><page>
Its serene aura. Its glittering surface. This lake is
exquisitely beautiful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1376]
It is a source of life-giving water for the townsfolk...<wait><page>
And, perhaps more importantly, it is the holy abode of the
town's spiritual guardian.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1377]
My, do you doubt me? It's true.<wait><page>
I occasionally feel a distinctly divine presence when I visit
this lake.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1378]
But I digress. Allow me to get to the point. Would you
believe me if I told you that this lake...<wait><page>
...This splendid, magnificent lake...
HAS NO NAME?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1379]
Could there be any greater blasphemy?
No, I think not.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1380]
Thus, I resolved to come up with a name befitting this
gorgeous lake so filled with solemn natural energies.<wait><page>
And while I was pondering this quandary, you arrived.
It is almost as if Mother Nature guided you to me
Herself, no?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1381]
Will you answer Her calling and assist me in devising an
appropriate name for the lake?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1382]
What sort of name do you think would be most fitting?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1383]
Something angelic.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1384]
Something mystical.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1385]
Something dignified.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1386]
An angelic name?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1387]
Hrm. I can see how this would be a place where even
angels might come to rest their wings. Interesting.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1388]
You know, you have an unexpectedly poetic aesthetic
sense. I may have to revise my opinion of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1389]
A mystical name? Hrm.<wait><page>
A good choice. A name that conveys the otherworldly,
enigmatic properties this lake possesses would indeed be
fitting.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1390]
A dignified name?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1391]
Well, of course the name must possess an air of nobility.
I thought that obvious.<wait><page>
To give this lake a mere common name would be
blasphemy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1392]
Ah...! Wait a moment...<wait><page>
Your words...they have planted a seed of inspiration
within me!<wait><page>
I can feel it... The name of this lake is...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1393]
ISABELLA!<wait><page>
Yes... Beauty. Mystery. Divinity. The name "Isabella"
encompasses all of its myriad nuances.<wait><page>
It is a name that truly suits this singular body of water
like no other.<wait><page>
Don't you agree?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1394]
Ahaha. There. Aren't you glad we gave you the perfect
name, Isabella?<wait><page>
Thank you, <playername>. The true name of this lake
can be our little secret.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1395]
Why aren't we going to tell the other townsfolk, you ask?<wait><page>
Goodness, why would we? We need not announce it to the
world. So long as we call Isabella by name, that is enough.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1396]
Besides, that secrecy is what makes it truly special,
does it not?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1397]
Well, Ms. Lillia?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1398]
Oh, how lovely!<wait><page>
Thank you again, Jenny... Hm?<wait><page>
My, my! If it isn't <playername>.
Hello, sweetie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1399]
Oh, how lovely!<wait><page>
Thank you again, Jenny... Hm?<wait><page>
My, my! If it isn't <playername>.
Hello, sweetie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1400]
Hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1401]
Hm? Ah, hello. I am here to deliver a sachet of potpourri
to Ms. Lillia.<wait><page>
I make them with flowers I've found in the mountains
and dried.<wait><page>
They are primarily for my personal satisfaction,
but I share them with others from time to time.<wait><page>
I think that this blend will help transport Ms. Lillia to the
mountains in spirit, if not in body.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1402]
Jenny really does blend the best potpourri. Everything
she makes smells so wonderful.<wait><page>
I feel like an excitable little girl every time I hear she's
bringing another sachet by.<wait><page>
Oh, I do so love potpourri...if you couldn't guess from my
daughter's name.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1403]
Actually, I was thinking of bringing some potpourri to
YOU later, <playername>.<wait><page>
I specifically tailor each blend I make to the recipient's
tastes. May it transport you somewhere peaceful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1404]
I told you, THIS one is better!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1405]
No, it ISN'T!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1406]
Oh, dear. They're arguing again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1407]
And right when we have guests, too. I'm so very sorry.<wait><page>
They really are sweet children, but somehow, they
always find a way to butt heads with one another.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1408]
Oh? Yet open disagreement is a sign that they trust one
other enough to express their true feelings.<wait><page>
Of course, it isn't good to let one's temper take control
and say hurtful things or, heaven forbid, use violence.<wait><page>
But I can see no danger with those two. Their arguments
are an expression of their affection for one another.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1409]
I must admit, I felt a small pang of jealousy. If only I, too,
had a partner with whom I could argue so passionately.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1410]
Looking at Rick and Popuri, it is plain that they were
both raised with care and affection.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1411]
Thanks in no small part to a wonderful and loving mother,
I'm sure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1412]
Oh, Jenny! That was so sweet! Thank you.<wait><page>
You know? Hearing you say that makes me feel much
better.<wait><page>
For someone who marches to the beat of her own drum
as much as you do, Jenny, you make some very astute
observations.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1413]
Ahaha. I like to think it is precisely for that reason that
I can, actually.<wait><page>
Perhaps that is why I've always cultivated a more free
and unrestrained worldview.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1414]
Ugh, Riiick! Why do you always have to--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1415]
Me?! YOU'RE the one who's always--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1416]
...They may be arguing because they love each other,
but I still think I'm going to put a stop to it.<wait><page>
I'm really sorry. This should only take a minute.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1417]
Arguing may be a sign of how much they care for each
other...<wait><page>
But I can't commend them for doing it to the extent that
it worries and annoys their mother.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1418]
Hm? You seem surprised by how much I observe the
people around me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1419]
Ahaha. To be honest, I generally take pains to not
interfere with the affairs of others.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1420]
However, Ms. Lillia seemed rather vexed, so I thought to
make a special exception for her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1421]
Wow. You aren't a total space case.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1422]
Wow. You have a great heart.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1423]
Goodness, how rude. Me, a space case?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1424]
I most certainly am no such thing. What about me would
ever make you think that?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1425]
Oh? I'm flattered that you would think so...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1426]
But I'm afraid that I am not a particularly kind person
at heart.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1427]
I simply prioritize harmony, that's all. And in order to
maintain a peaceful coexistence with others...<wait><page>
It is critical to focus on the merits and talents of
everyone around you, rather than their faults.<wait><page>
After all, you must first give love and respect if you want
to receive it in turn.<wait><page>
That goes not just for human beings, but for animals and
even nature itself.<wait><page>
I am simply putting that concept into practice. That is all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1428]
Goodness, listen to me. Here I am, talking your ear off.
My apologies.<wait><page>
For some reason, talking with you seems to loosen my
tongue and I end up prattling on for hours.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1429]
Well, I am very flattered by your compliment.<wait><page>
It's odd. For some reason, being with you puts me at ease.<wait><page>
Perhaps our souls are resonating on a similar
wavelength. Aha ha ha.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1430]
By the by, Ms. Lillia certainly is taking some time
to return.<wait><page>
Hrm. Perhaps I will take my leave, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1431]
Here. I believe this will be a quiet enough spot for us to
continue our discussion.<wait><page>
That you have presented me with such a special token
means, I presume, that you would like for us to begin
dating?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1432]
Here. I believe this will be a quiet enough spot for us to

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1433]
I see. I accept.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1434]
Well, I AM in love with you, after all. Both as a person
and as an integral aspect of the natural world.<wait><page>
You are a person who loves and respects the world, living
hand in hand with Mother Nature.<wait><page>
How could I not love someone like you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1435]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1436]
Excellent. Our relationship is now one of man and woman
entwined in romance.<wait><page>
I vow that I shall offer to you every last ounce of love
that I possess.<wait><page>
I look forward to seeing how we continue to resonate in
body and soul, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1437]
Excellent. Our relationship is now one of two women
entwined in romance.<wait><page>
I vow that I shall offer to you every last ounce of love
that I possess.<wait><page>
I look forward to seeing how we continue to resonate in
body and soul, <playername>.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1438]
Ah, <playername>. Just who I wanted to see.<wait><page>
You have excellent timing. I'm about to put on a pot
of tea.<wait><page>
Would you care to join me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1439]
Wonderful. Could I ask you to step outside and wait
a moment, then?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1440]
Well? Does it suit your palate?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1441]
I'm glad.<wait><page>
It is a special herbal tea that I blended myself.
I'm delighted you enjoy it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1442]
Why, yes. It IS made from herbs I picked just this morning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1443]
Even without going to a store, you can make delicious and
nourishing meals using what can be found in nature alone.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1444]
Of course, you are a farmer. I expect you're the last
person who needs this sort of lecture.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1445]
Do I not purchase anything from stores? Well, as much as
I wish otherwise, there are things I cannot find
elsewhere.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1446]
But to buy things, one first needs to have the requisite
money. I prefer to avoid handling money as much as I can.<wait><page>
I want to live my life in tune with Mother Nature. Only
the barest minimum of money is plenty sufficient for me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1447]
Besides, an excess of money can easily lead one astray.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1448]
Have I ever spoken to you of my past?<wait><page>
I was born into a very wealthy family.<wait><page>
Papa spent his life solving every issue he had with money.
Mama was raised like a princess.<wait><page>
For as long as I can remember, I was told over and over
that I must grow up to be a proper lady and a good wife.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1449]
I grew sick of hearing that, as you might imagine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1450]
I am aware that one needs money to get by in this world,
and that being destitute can pose its own problems.<wait><page>
But I believe our more pressing concern should be finding
our own path to happiness, regardless of finances. <wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1451]
I could not see myself ever being truly happy in that
home. Thus, I cast it all aside and ran away.<wait><page>
And please don't bother lecturing me on how that was a
foolish choice by a naïve rich girl. I've heard that one
enough.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1452]
I bet your parents are worried.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1453]
Happiness trumps wealthiness.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1454]
Oh? I wouldn't be so sure.<wait><page>
I had no intention of fulfilling the role they assigned to
me. I expect I would have been dismissed eventually.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1455]
I knew you would understand.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1456]
Happiness is something we can only decide for ourselves.<wait><page>
Whether it be through connections with others, wealth,
or becoming one with nature...<wait><page>
Everyone must find their own answer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1457]
To me, happiness is attuning with nature and spending
time with someone who loves me, chatting and smiling all
the while.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1458]
I do not regret running away from home one bit. In fact,
not a single day has passed where I haven't felt satisfied.<wait><page>
Now, I wake by the twittering of the birds, breathe in
fresh mountain air, and sip delicious herbal tea.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1459]
THAT is the true meaning of "richness"--richness of the
body and soul. I could not dream of a more fulfilling life.<wait><page>
Living in harmony with nature and basking in the serenity
of peace... This is the happiest I've ever been.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1460]
And not only that, I have been blessed with a wonderful
boyfriend in you, <playername>.<wait><page>
I believe it is vital for us as human beings to cultivate
such precious relationships.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1461]
Not only that, I have been blessed with
a wonderful girlfriend in you, <playername>.<wait><page>
I believe it is vital for us as human beings to cultivate
such precious relationships.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1462]
...There I go, prattling on again. About uninteresting
stories from my past, no less. I apologize.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1463]
Though I DID mean to tell you about it someday. You are
my boyfriend, and you are important to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1464]
Though I DID mean to tell you about it someday. You are
my girlfriend, and you are important to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1465]
My. What brings you here at this hour,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1466]
You simply came to visit me?<wait><page>
Ahaha. Oh, you flatterer, you. I don't advise being out and
about at this hour, though. It isn't safe.<wait><page>
Wait just a moment. I'll go and put on some tea for us.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1467]
I...feel kind of funny...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1468]
Ah! Are you awake? How do you feel?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1469]
I had half a mind to take you to the Clinic, but you didn't
seem to have a fever, so I simply observed you.<wait><page>
Given how you look, it seems there is nothing to worry
about.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1470]
Still, it would be best if you kept your exertion to a
minimum. You may stay here until you have fully
recovered.<wait><page>
Good night, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1471]
Ah. Are you awake?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1472]
I made some spiced hot milk and rice porridge for you.<wait><page>
It ought to warm you and help you relax. I'll bring it over
in a moment.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1473]
Still...<wait><page>
It was quite a shock to see someone as full of vim and
vigor as you suddenly keel over out of nowhere.<wait><page>
I understand that you enjoy your work, but perhaps you
ought to go about it in a more leisurely fashion, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1474]
I have the utmost respect for how you unflinchingly put
everything you have into your work, <playername>.<wait><page>
Watching you go about your farm work with happiness
on your face and peace in your heart makes me feel
happy as well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1475]
But if you are pushing yourself to the point of collapse,
I can't turn a blind eye.<wait><page>
Please. Starting tomorrow, set aside your work and
focus on your recovery instead.<wait><page>
Can you promise me that you will?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1476]
Farmers don't get sick days.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1477]
I'll try not to worry you.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1478]
Your honesty is one of your best qualities,
<playername>.<wait><page>
But at this moment, I would really rather you promise to
take care of yourself.<wait><page>
After all...I'm worried for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1479]
...Thank you.<wait><page>
Knowing you, I was afraid you might say something like
"farmers don't get sick days."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1480]
As long as you understand, all is well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1481]
Now, allow me to fetch that hot milk and porridge
for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1482]
Wait a moment...what in Mother Nature's name
am I saying?<wait><page>
I dislike the idea of binding others or being bound myself,
yet here I am insisting he make a promise to me?<wait><page>
Goodness. Can being in love truly change a person this
much?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1484]
This is so very out of character for me. What has gotten
into me, I wonder...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1485]
Yes, this seems like a quiet enough spot.<wait><page>
Ms. Lillia informed me of the blue feather's significance.
According to her...<wait><page>
...they are customarily presented in this town to signify
a marriage proposal.<wait><page>
Do you mean it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1487]
I see.<wait><page>
Ah, please don't misunderstand. I'm elated, to say the
least. I have long dreamed of you proposing to me.<wait><page>
If I'm together with you, I know we will achieve happiness
in all aspects of our new life as a family.<wait><page>
Mother Nature Herself will bless us with Her radiant
energy. Of that I'm sure.<wait><page>
<playername>...will you marry me?<wait>

[1490]
Yes...!<wait><page>
I want to be together with you until we are both
old and wrinkled!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1491]
Personally, I wouldn't mind a private ceremony between
just the two of us...<wait><page>
But it would be nice to receive the blessings and goodwill
of our friends and loved ones.<wait><page>
I'll go and inform the mayor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1492]
Aah, so it's wedding bells for the two of you? Wonderful!
Congratulations to you both!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1493]
Aah, so it's wedding bells for the two of you? Wonderful!
Congratulations to you lucky ladies!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1494]
I had always imagined you as a free and independent
spirit blowing through life without a care in the world,
Jennifer.<wait><page>
But it seems you have found a place to call home at last.
I'm glad for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1495]
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Harris.<wait><page>
It's likely I will continue to spend much of my time on the
mountain, so...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1496]
If you happen to see me on one of your patrols, I'd like it
if you would come chat with me as you always have.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1497]
Of course! <playername>'s house is close to the
mountain, too, conveniently enough.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1498]
That it is.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1499]
Now, you two leave all the arrangements for the wedding
ceremony to me.<wait><page>
I will see to it that a proper venue is reserved and all the
invitations are sent.<wait><page>
Considering all the preparations that need to be made,
I imagine the ceremony will be in about a week or so.<wait>

<playername>. Jennifer. Do you both swear to take
each other as your sole partner for the rest of your
lives...<wait><page>
To have and to hold, to respect and to cherish,
your hearts as one no matter what may come?
For now, and forever?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1505]
Oh, you both look so lovely! ♪ Goodness, I...I think I'm about
to cry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1506]
Congratulations, Jennifer! I wish both you and
<playername> the very best!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Hrm. The idea of this ceremony didn't interest me at
first, but it turned out to be a pleasantly dignified affair.<wait><page>
It has even given me some inspiration.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1509]
I love you, <playername>. May our energies continue
to resonate with the beauty of man and woman united
as one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1510]
I love you, <playername>. May our energies continue
to resonate with the beauty of two women united as one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1511]
It was rather nerve-racking to stand in front
of all those people...<wait><page>
But it was worth it to know they were all wishing
us well.<wait><page>
And now...we really are married, aren't we?<wait>

Oh, I have an idea. How about we give each other new
nicknames?<wait><page>
I've always fancied the idea of having special names that
only we use. What do you think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1514]
So it shall be. From now on, you're my darling
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1515]
You would like me to call you something else, hm? Such as?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1516]
May Mother Nature Herself bless every day of our new
lives together, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1517]
Everything will be fine. I'll keep working, and I'll still come
to visit you whenever my schedule allows.<wait><page>
Yu, you'd better behave so that you don't make trouble
for Grandma.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1518]
And so, I bid you farewell. Until we meet again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1519]
You may now exchange your rings.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1520]
I always use herbs and leaves that I have picked myself
in my teas.<wait><page>
I drew the water from the river nearby, so I guess you
could say this tea is entirely of the mountain's bounty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1521]
To me, happiness is attuning with nature and spending
time with someone who loves me, chatting and smiling all
