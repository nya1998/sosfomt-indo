Ah ha! It looks like <string0>
is pregnant.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0001]
Huh? Nothing happened.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0002]
I don't have a Breeding Bin available.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0003]
My Barn is too full. I can't take in any more animals.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0004]
<playername>, hello. Do you have a moment?
I have a favor to ask...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0005]
You see, this little foal of mine here isn't feeling too well.
It needs a little extra care.<wait><page>
Unfortunately, I don't have the time to give it that care.
I was hoping you might raise it for me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0006]
Ah, but I would truly appreciate your help with this...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0007]
Or...can you not do it?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0008]
Accept
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0009]
Decline
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0010]
I see. Well, if you can't, then you can't. I won't bother you
with this again. Good day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0011]
You will? Good, good! I knew I could count on you.<wait><page>
Well then, why not give this little one a name?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0012]
There isn't much to worry yourself over when it comes
to raising horses.<wait><page>
Just give â€˜em lots of love and care, and that'll be plenty.<wait><page>
Talk to them every day, yeah? They do love
hearing your voice.<wait><page>
Brushing them every day is good for them too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0013]
All right, then. I'll take this little one on over
to your Stable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0014]
Once it's grown, I'll come back for it.<wait><page>
Take good care of it for me until then.
I'm counting on you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0015]
<playername>, hello. I've come to check in on little
<string0>.<wait><page>
I'm thinking it should be about grown by now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0016]
Hrm... Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0017]
Good, good! I can tell you spent the last 90 days raising
<string0> with lots of love and care.
You've done a fine job. You pass.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0018]
As thanks for your hard work, I don't mind letting you
keep <string0> as your own.<wait><page>
They seem like they're quite fond of you, after all.<wait><page>
Well then, keep taking excellent care of little...
Well, big <string0> now.
I know I can count on you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0019]
Hrm... Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0020]
No, no, no. This won't do at all, <playername>.<wait><page>
It's been an entire year, but you haven't shown
<string0> enough love.
I'm afraid I have to fail you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0021]
I'll be taking <string0> back home
with me, then. Good day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0022]
<playername>, hello. I can't help but notice you don't
have a single horse on your farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0023]
This here is one that I raised. I'll let you have it.
It'll make things seem a bit more farm-y.<wait><page>
You can give it a name too, if you'd like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0024]
Now then, I'll go take this little one to your barn.<wait><page>
Show it lots of love every day, y'hear? Don't forget to
talk to it and give it a good brushing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0025]
I'll leave <myhorsename> in your care, then. Good day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

You want this <string1>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0032]
There's a good little one.
Hurry and grow up strong, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0033]
Uh-oh. It looks like this one is plotting something...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

The cows here always look so cute and happy.<wait>
