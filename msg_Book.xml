Mini-Games with the Nature Sprites
Let's Play with the Nature Sprites!
[Harvesting]

Have you met the Nature Sprites yet?
Are you becoming fast friends already?
If not, you really ought to get to know them.
If you play with them often enough, they
will be more than happy to lend you a hand.


One of the games you can play with the
Nature Sprites is the Harvesting Game.
Repeatedly hit the Confirm Button to have
the Nature Sprite harvest more and more
Turnips. 

The key to victory lies in how fast
you press the button. If you hammer on it
for too long, the Nature Sprite will become
sweaty and start having a hard time.
At the end of the game, mistakes are
subtracted from your overall score as
negative points. Once a Sprite's face becomes
sweaty, simply leaving them be won't return
them to normal. Instead, when you see
that telltale sign of exhaustion, don't let
up on the Confirm Button entirely; press it
much more slowly to let them rest. 
Give this game a try and show the world
what an agricultural ace you are!
Let's Play with the Nature Sprites!
[Feeding Chickens]

Are you best buds with the Nature Sprites
yet? They won't play with you unless you
are. There are lots of benefits to being
friends with the Nature Sprites, not the
least of which is that warm and fuzzy
feeling you're sure to get inside!

One of the games you can play with the
Nature Sprites is the Feeding Chickens
game. In this game, a Nature Sprite will
feed five chickens while you pay close
attention to each bird's behavior. If you
don't keep a watchful eye, those crafty
cluckers will fly the Coop before you can
say "omelette du fromage." Also, be careful
not to feed a chicken while its Bin is full.
Otherwise, it will just get angry.
At the end of the game, mistakes are
subtracted from your overall score as
negative points. Watch each chicken, and
when it looks like one's Bin is starting to
empty, quickly have the Nature Sprite fill
it back up. Keep in mind that you do not
need to put feed in every single Bin.
It's up to you to devise your own strategy
for keeping your avian amigos fed in
record time!
Let's Play with the Nature Sprites!
[Watering Crops]

Are you constantly relying on the Nature
Sprites to help you with work? Remember,
they're friends, not field hands! Make sure
to chat with them and give them presents
so they don't feel like your friendship is
one-sided.

One of the games you can play with the
Nature Sprites is the Watering Crops game.
Move the Nature Sprite and have them
water the indicated rows in the indicated
order. Each round of the game will have
three patterns. If you can memorize when
to water where, you'll be sure to rack up a
high score. But be careful! Water out of
sequence, and the Nature Sprite will not
be a happy camper.
At the end of the game, mistakes will be
subtracted from your score as negative
points. Also, if you mess up the order, any
rows watered after the mistake won't count.
If you feel like you're in over your head,
take a moment to think and remember the
correct pattern. Also, each round of the
game has three patterns, so even if you
mess one up, you will have a chance to
make up for it. Keep fighting until the end!

Festival Tips and Tricks
☆Derby Tips and Tricks

Every Spring and Autumn 18, a Derby
will be held in Rose Plaza. The mayor will
visit your house the morning before race
day to let you know about it, so if you own
a horse, feel free to saddle up and join in.

However, keep in mind that only fully mature
horses are eligible for entry. 
During a Derby, pressing the Confirm Button
will encourage your horse, making it run
faster. However, if you simply mash the
button, your horse will soon tire itself out.
The trick is to use it sparingly, at just the
right time.




If you decide to buy a racing ticket, don't
always play the odds--it's fun to root for
the underdog (underhorse?) sometimes!
But most of all, it's important to raise your
horse with lots of love and care. Practice
riding often, and you will be running like
the wind before you know it.

With the help of this guide, you, too,
can jockey to become a Derby Champion.
☆Cluck-Cluck Clash Tips and Tricks

Every year on Summer 7, the Cluck-Cluck
Clash is held in Rose Plaza. Rick will visit
your house the morning before festival day
to let you know about it, so if you own a
chicken, feel free to join in on the action.



However, keep in mind that you can't enter
the Cluck-Cluck Clash with a chick. Only fully
mature chickens are eligible for entry.

During the Cluck-Cluck Clash, you can press
the Confirm Button to cheer on your chicken,
causing it to startle the opposing chicken.
Whichever chicken turns tailfeather and
runs out of the ring first loses.

The most important factor in the Cluck-Cluck
Clash is your chicken's motivation. If they
aren't feeling the Clash fever, they won't
pay attention to your cheering.

A chicken's motivation is closely tied to its
affection for its owner, making a good
relationship very important. Raise them
with lots of TLC, and soon your bonds of
companionship shall render you undefeatable.
With these nuggets of wisdom held closely
to your breast, we are sure that you, too,
can become a Cluck-Cluck Clash Champion.

Raising Crops
◆ First, clear the land you want to farm.
Remove or destroy obstructions like
Weeds, Branches, and Stones.

◆ Use your Hoe to till the land.





◆ Spread seeds on the tilled land.
One bag of seeds will spread in a 3x3
square (with you in the center).
   ※Seeds spread on untilled land
    won't grow.
   ※Seeds planted in the wrong season
    won't grow.



◆ Water your seeds diligently, and
eventually, they will sprout. You only
need to water them once per day.
   ※Watering seeds twice or more in
    a day does nothing.
   ※It isn't necessary to water seeds on
    a rainy day.



◆ Crops are ready to harvest when they
turn ripe. Different crops will mature and
ripen in different amounts of time.
   ※Some crops will ripen once and revert
    to an empty tilled plot when harvested.
    Others will remain at a certain level of
    growth after harvesting. In these cases,
    keep watering them and they will ripen
    again.

☆Fodder (Spring, Summer, Autumn)
Place Grass Seedlings on farmland that
you have NOT tilled. Starting the next day,
the Grass will expand to neighboring
squares at a rate of one square per day.
It does not need to be watered, but it
won't grow if obstructed in any way.
Cut it with a Sickle to revert the square
to regular land.

Monitoring Your Stamina and Fatigue
☆Stamina
You need Stamina to use the tools you
equip. How much Stamina is required will
vary depending on the level of the tool. 

Eating a Power Berry will increase your
maximum Stamina. Yum!



To recover your Stamina, you can:
◆ Sleep.
◆ Soak in the Hot Spring.

 ※How much Stamina you recover will
   depend on how long you spend doing
   either activity. The longer you sleep or
   soak, the more you will recover.


◆ Eat food.
 ※How much Stamina you recover depends
   on what food you eat. Some food may even
   deplete your Stamina, so watch out!
◆ Put flowers in a Vase.
 ※Some flowers do not have a Stamina
    recovery effect.



☆Fatigue
You accumulate Fatigue when doing things
like working outside in poor weather,
working at late hours, or using tools when
you have no Stamina. Become too fatigued,
and you will collapse and be taken to the
Clinic.

 ※Once admitted to the Clinic, you will lose
   the remainder of the day while you rest.
Eating a Mystery Berry will slow your rate
of Fatigue accumulation by half.

To relieve Fatigue, you can:
◆ Sleep.
◆ Soak in the Hot Spring.
 ※How much Fatigue is relieved will
   depend on how long you spend doing
   either activity. The longer you sleep or
   soak, the better you will feel.
◆ Eat food.
 ※How much Fatigue is relieved depends
   on what food you eat. Some food may even
   make you more fatigued. Yikes!
◆ Put flowers in a Vase.
 ※Some flowers do not have this effect.
◆ Put wood in your Fireplace.
 ※This is effective only in winter. Do this
in any other season, and you will instead
BUILD Fatigue.

Your Tools and What They Do
☆Sickle
  - Reap Fodder/various crops.
  - Cut down Weeds.
  
The base Sickle will only cut whatever
is in the single square in front of you. 
Once upgraded at the Forge, it will cut
greater swaths depending on its level
and how long you charge it up.

☆Hoe
  - Till the land.
  - Re-till a crop that hasn't sprouted, or 
    spots you've just harvested Fodder from.
  - Dig in the mines.

Once upgraded at the Forge, it will till
greater swaths depending on its level.
※The Hoe's charge ability doesn't work in the
mines.
☆Axe
  - Chop Branches and Stumps.
※You can also use it to destroy the trees
 you plant on your farm.

The base Axe will only chop Branches.
Once upgraded at the Forge, it can even
chop tree stumps. It will also chop
things in fewer strokes, depending on its
level and how long you charge it up.
☆Hammer
  - Break Stones, Big Rocks, Boulders,
fences, and broken fences.
  - Revert tilled land to un-tilled land.
  - Break rocks in the mines.

The base Hammer won't be able to break
Big Rocks and Boulders until it's upgraded
at the Forge.

☆Watering Can
  - Water tilled fields.
  - Can be filled at any water source.

The base Watering Can will only water
whatever is in the single square directly in
front of you. Once upgraded at the Forge, it
will water greater swaths depending on its
level and how long you charge it up. It will
also hold more water at once.
☆Fishing Rod
  Catch fish at any body of water.

You will catch different kinds of fish
depending on the season, location, and
how much you charge the Fishing Rod up.




☆Seeds
  Plant them on tilled fields.
  (Seeds are spread in a 3X3 square
   around you.)

Seeds planted anywhere but on tilled fields
will not grow.  Whether you plant seeds on
the whole 3X3 square around you, or on just
one single square, it will still use one
whole bag of seeds.
Each seed will grow only in a certain
season. Plant them in any other season
and they won't grow.

Turnip Seeds
Potato Seeds
Cucumber Seeds
Strawberry Seeds
Cabbage Seeds
Fodder Seedlings
Moondrop Flower Seeds
Toy Flower Seeds

[Summer]:
Tomato Seeds
Corn Seeds
Pumpkin Seeds
Pineapple Seeds

(Probably better to just hit up the mines.)







☆Pedometer
  Counts the number of steps you've taken,
  so long as it is in your bag or equipped.

☆Preserved Flower
  Ask that special someone to date you.

☆Blue Feather
  Ask that special someone to marry you.

☆Brush
  Use to take care of your cows, sheep,
  alpacas, and horse.

(Using it once a day is plenty. Overly
aggressive but well-intentioned brushing
has no extra effect.)



☆Milker
Use to milk a healthy, adult cow once a day.
Calves and pregnant cows can't be milked.
The more affection your cows have for you, 
the larger size Milk they will give you.





☆Clippers
Use to shear mature sheep, alpacas, and
Angora rabbits. One shearing will take the
animal's entire coat, and it won't regrow
for several days. The more affection your
animals have for you, the larger size Wool,
Fleece, and Fur they will give you.



☆Animal Breeding Kits
  Use to breed the animal of the
  named type.

You can't breed your animals if your Barn or
Coop is full, or if the available breeding
slots are already being used. You can't
breed shearable animals until they have
fully grown in their coat.

Fishing
Once you have a Fishing Rod, an entire
world of ichthyological excitement awaits!

☆How to Acquire a Fishing Rod
Rumor has it that one of Zack's old buddies
used to have a real thing for fishing. If you
talk to Zack, maybe he'll be able to help.



☆How to Fish
Equip your fishing rod and go to a body of
water that seems like it might have fish.
Press the Tool Button to cast your line.

Then begins your fishy vigil. Patience!

When you get a bite, the bobber will bob up
and down drastically. From there, quickly
press the Tool Button to reel in your catch.
If your catch gets away, don't fret. Simply
wait patiently for the next bite. There are
times when you might press the button in
time, but the fish still escapes. Don't give
up. Steel yourself and cast your line again.
Certain bodies of water won't have any fish.
If you find yourself waiting and waiting for
what seems like forever without any bites,
try moving to a different location.

☆Fishing Spots
There are various fishing spots all around
Mineral Town.

◆The Ocean
  You can fish from Mineral Beach.

◆Downstream
  You can fish in the river flowing through
  Southside and across your farm. 
◆The Spring
  You can fish in the Spring next to the mine.

◆Upstream
  You can fish near the bridge behind the
  mountain. (It's a very small spot.)

◆The Lake
  You can fish at the large lake behind the
  mountain. 
◆And more...

There are other little fishing holes tucked
around Mineral Town. Find them and you
may be able to reel in something truly
unique!

How to Raise Livestock
☆What Livestock Are Available?
On your farm, you can raise chickens,
Angora rabbits, cows, sheep, and alpacas.
Take good care of them, and they will
give you Eggs, Milk, Wool, and more. 

Livestock are an important part of farm life.
Raise and breed them well to cultivate a
richer and more rewarding experience.

☆Chickens
Chickens lay Eggs. Put an Egg in the
Incubator, and three days later, a chick
will hatch. A chick will grow into a fully
mature chicken in one week's time.

Chickens come in brown and white
varieties, but aside from color, there is
no difference between them.

☆Angora Rabbits
You can shear mature Angora rabbits for
their Fur. Once shorn, their coat will grow
back completely in one week. Use an
Angora Breeding Kit on an adult Angora
rabbit to breed it. A kit will be born about
five days later. When fed daily, a kit will
grow into a fully mature Angora rabbit in
ten days.

☆Cows
You can milk mature cows. 
※The type of Milk you get will depend on
the type of cow.
Use a Cow Breeding Kit on a cow to breed it.
A calf will be born in about three weeks.
When fed every day, a calf will grow into
an adolescent cow in two weeks, and then
into a fully mature cow one week after that.

☆Sheep
You can shear mature sheep for their Wool.
Once shorn, their coat will grow back
completely in one week. Use a Sheep 
Breeding Kit on a mature sheep to breed it.
A lamb will be born about three weeks later.
When fed every day, a lamb will grow into 
a fully mature sheep in about two weeks.


☆Alpacas
You can shear mature alpaca for their Fleece.
Once shorn, their coat will grow back
completely in one week. Use an Alpaca
Breeding Kit on a mature alpaca to breed it.
A cria will be born about three weeks later.
If fed every day, a cria will grow into a fully
mature alpaca in about two weeks.


☆Raising Livestock
All of your livestock have an affection
level that will increase or decrease
depending on how you care for them.
To raise their affection, you will need to
talk to them and brush them every day.
Feeding them daily goes without saying.



Take good care of your animals, and their
affection for you will go higher and higher.
As their affection rises, the quality of the
byproducts they produce will also increase.






☆Putting Your Animals Out to Pasture
Moving your livestock out of their Barn or
Coop is called putting them out to pasture.
To put all your animals out, ring the bell
in front of your Barn or Coop. At 8:00 PM,
your animals will automatically return to
their Barn or Coop. (Aren't they smart?)



When you leave chickens and Angora
rabbits outside for a time, they will start to
forage for their own feed. For your cows,
sheep, and alpacas, if you have fully
grown Grass nearby, they will eat that.





Putting your animals out to pasture often
helps increase their affection for you.
This will also help improve the quality of
their byproducts, so giving them plenty of
time outdoors is highly recommended.

Cooking Basics 1
☆About Cooking Inspiration

When you're cooking, have you ever
suddenly been hit with an idea for a brand-
new recipe? These flashes of inspiration
can happen once you use certain
ingredients a set number of times. 



To get your creative juices flowing, it's 
a good idea to practice your recipes a lot.
Even making the same dish several times
can lead to new ideas. Using higher-quality
ingredients when you cook will help
inspiration strike sooner rather than later.




Teasing out some inspirations may require
practice with a set of ingredients, rather
than with just a single ingredient.
For example, using Ingredient A three times
and Ingredient B five times may lead to an
idea for a new dish!




With these tips, you too can become the
master of your own Kitchen! Start simple,
keep practicing, and open yourself up to
new culinary possibilities!

Tah-taaah!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0056]
Cooking Basics 2
☆Ingredients and Recipes to Incite Inspiration -
Beginner Level

Here are a few ingredients and recipes that
are likely to give you that little spark of
inspiration you need to hit on a new recipe.
As this is the Beginner Level, these will be
common and easily acquired ingredients.


EGGS
There are a very large number of recipes
that call for Eggs. They're easy to come by,
too, if you keep your own chicken and care
for it well. With a steady supply at your
disposal, you'll be an Egg whiz in no time!




Some recipes you may discover while
making Egg dishes include:
 - Boiled Eggs
 - Omelet Rice
 - French Toast

Scramble up as many Egg dishes as you can,
and you'll be adding page after page of eggy
goodness to your cookbook in no time flat!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0057]

Flour, which you can purchase from the
General Store. Stock up and try your hand at
lots of different recipes!





Some recipes you may discover while

are likely to give you that little spark of
inspiration you need to hit on a new recipe.
As this is Advanced Level, these ingredients
will be rarer and harder to acquire.


MOCHI
Not only are there only a handful of recipes
that call for Mochi, but there is only a
specific time of year that you can get any!
If you DO get your hands on some, we highly
recommend trying out as many recipes with

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0059]
Obtaining a Kitchen
A Kitchen is absolutely essential if you
want to explore the exciting world of
home cooking!

You can't place a Kitchen in a small
house, so you'll want to upgrade to
the Slightly Bigger House. Once you do,
your Kitchen will be complete!


With a Kitchen, you'll be able to do all
sorts of cooking, but you'll need to make
sure you've got a place to store the
necessary ingredients. A Fridge, 
which allows you to store and save the
food you cook, is highly recommended!




A variety of cooking utensils will go on sale
once you've upgraded your house. Purchase
them to complement your new Kitchen!

With a suite of trusty cooking utensils at
your disposal, you'll be able to cook an
even greater variety of culinary delights!
Have fun collecting them all!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0060]
Help from the Nature Sprites
Have you met the Nature Sprites yet? If you
make friends with them, you can ask them
to help you with some of your daily chores.



You can ask the Nature Sprites for help
with three different types of chores...


◆ Watering Crops
They will water all the crops on your farm.

◆ Harvesting Crops
They will harvest all of the ripe crops on
your farm. "Ripe" on!




◆ Livestock Care
They will take care of your livestock,
including feeding them, brushing them,
and shipping Eggs, Milk, Wool, or other
available byproducts.





The more a Nature Sprite helps you with a
certain chore, the better and more efficient
they will get at it. But if you keep putting
them to work without giving them anything
in return, they will eventually grow upset.

Make sure you chat with them and give
them presents to stay in their good graces.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0061]
Saibara's Forge
◆ Through the magic of metalworking, you
  can buy and upgrade the tools needed to
  take care of your farm and animals here.
  But that's not all--Saibara's place is also
  your one-stop shop for accessories and
  Makers to help you "make" the most of
  your animal byproducts.



◆ Hours
  10:00 AM - 4:00 PM

◆ Closed
  Thursdays





☆Upgrading Your Tools
 ◆ Upgrade your tools and you will unlock
  "charge skills" that you can use by holding
  down the Tool Button. Charge skills will let
  you use the tool's ability over a wider
  range, or break tougher objects.
 ◆ To upgrade a tool, first put the tool and
  the ores required to level it up into your
  bag. Then, go to Saibara, talk to him over
  the counter, and request an upgrade. 
 ◆ While Saibara is working on the upgrade,
  the Forge will be closed, and you won't
  have access to your tool. But once his
  work is finished, the Forge will reopen and
  you can talk to him to get your upgraded
  tool. Make sure you have an open tool slot,
  or you won't be able to pick up the item.



◆ Tools that can be upgraded:
- Hoe
- Sickle
- Axe
- Hammer
- Watering Can
- Fishing Rod



◆ Time required to upgrade a tool:
  How long it takes to upgrade a tool
  depends on how many levels you want to
  strengthen it by at once. Reworking it from
  low to high level in one fell swoop will take
  longer than if you do one level at a time.




◆ The cost of upgrading a tool:
  How much an upgrade will cost depends on
  what level it is being upgraded to. Higher
  levels will cost more than lower levels.

◆ Tool experience:
  A tool's experience points will determine if
  it is ready to upgrade or not. Open the tool
  menu and press the Tool Level button to
  see what level it can be upgraded to. 
☆Tools For Animals
◆ Brushes
  Bristly tools used to maintain the coats
  of cows, sheep, alpacas, and horses.
◆ Milker
  A tool used to milk adult cows.
◆ Clippers
  A tool used to trim the coats off sheep,
  alpacas, and Angora rabbits.

☆Accessories
◆ Bracelets
◆ Necklaces
◆ Earrings
◆ Brooches

These may make nice presents for
someone... They require 1,000G and
a piece of Orichalcum to create, and
take two days to be made.
While Saibara is working on an
accessory, the Forge will be closed.
It will open again when the item is ready.
Talk to Saibara to retrieve it, but make sure
you have an open space in your item slots.





☆Makers

◆ Mayonnaise Maker
A machine that will make Mayonnaise
just by putting Eggs into it. The higher
quality the Egg you put into it, the higher
quality Mayonnaise you will get.



◆ Cheese Maker
A machine that will make Cheese just by
putting Milk into it. The higher quality the
Milk, the higher the quality the Cheese.

◆ Yarn Maker
A machine that will spin any animal Wool
or Fur into Yarn. The higher quality the
byproduct, the higher the quality the Yarn.

◆ Butter Maker
A machine that will make Butter just by
putting Milk into it.


◆ All four Makers cost 20,000G apiece.
They require Adamantite and take 5 days
to create.


While Saibara is working on a Maker,
the Forge will be closed. It will open again
when the item is ready, but you can kick
back and relax, because these babies
come with free delivery! Makers will
automatically be placed in your Coop or
Barn. You can only commission Makers
once you have renovated your Coop and Barn.

There's nothing wrong with taking a day off

Ah well. Take it easy.

A Starlight Night Invitation from Brandon
Do you have plans for Starlight Night? If not,
would you care to spend it with me? Gotts
as well. If you don't mind, could we come by
your house? Gotts' place is somewhat...untidy.
I will, of course, bring food in exchange.

If your answer is yes, meet us at Gotts'
house at 6:00 PM tomorrow.

A Starlight Night Invitation from Karen
Hey, you know tomorrow's Starlight Night,
right? Got any plans? If you want, you can 
come spend it at my place. I was thinking 
we could make a party of it. Mom's going to 
make some dinner, so you'd just need to 
show up. If that sounds cool with you, come 
by the General Store at 6:00 PM tomorrow.

Crazy how fast it snuck up on us, right?

Dad and I are gonna have a party at the Inn.
Wanna join us? I think it'll be a lot more

we'll be waiting at the Inn at 6:00 PM

How are you doing, <playername>?
I hope you haven't caught a winter cold!

A Starlight Night Invitation from Jennifer
While peaceful solitude has its merits,
there is also joy in celebrating with friends. 
Yes, this is indeed an invitation to a Starlight
Night party. I've sent one to Mugi as well.
However, a party at my tent could prove
problematic. Might we hold it at your place?
If this sounds amicable, please come by my
tent at 6:00 PM tomorrow. I'll be waiting.
