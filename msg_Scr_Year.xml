All right! Time to enjoy this feast of mochi!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0008]
My goodness! You all made so much mochi that we have
an abundance of leftovers.<wait><page>
You're welcome to bring some home with you.
Give them to people who couldn't make it here
today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0009]
<playername>, it seems your Bag is full.
What a shame...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0010]
The mochi was so good! ♪ Phew. Man, I'm full.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0011]
The mochi sure was delicious! ♪ But...I think I ate too much.
Ugh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0012]
The mochi sure was yummy! ♪ I even have some extras
to take back too. What a great day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0013]
Hey. You come to eat too? It's our one an' only mochi
event, after all. We gotta party!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0014]
Freshly made mochi is something real special.
One bite and you'll be a fan for life.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0015]
Yay, mochi! I LOVE fresh mochi.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0016]
Hello, <playername>. Have you come to eat some
mochi too?<wait><page>
It's one of my guilty pleasures. I might just help myself
to a few extras today...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0017]
It's been some time since I've had mochi. I'll have to bring
some back home for Grandma too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0018]
Fresh mochi is suuuper stretchy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0019]
It's so easy to overindulge when it comes to mochi.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0020]
Good evening, <playername>. Do you like mochi too?<wait><page>
I absolutely adore it. Though, if I eat too much, I know I'll
pay for it later.<wait><page>
But at least for today, I'll eat to my heart's content.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0021]
Mochi is simply divine. I confess I'm quite fond of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0022]
Getting together to make mochi is one of my favorite
events. I come every year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0023]
It's been ages since I had mochi. You can't get it up on the
mountain.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0024]
Yaaay! Mochi, mochi! ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0025]
Thwap... Thwap... Thwap... Thwap...
Thwap... Thwap... Thwap... Thwap...
Thwap... Thwap... Thwap... Thwap...<wait><page>
Hooray! The mochi is thoroughly pounded!<wait>

[0026]
Hello, <playername>.<wait><page>
We'll be holding the Spring Derby at 10:00 AM sharp in
the Plaza tomorrow.<wait><page>
If only you had a horse on your farm...
I'd have loved it if you could've entered it
and supported the event.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0027]
Hello, <playername>.<wait><page>
We'll be holding the Spring Derby at 10:00 AM sharp in
the Plaza tomorrow.<wait><page>
If only you had an adult horse on your farm...
I'd have loved it if you could've entered it
and supported the event.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0028]
Hello, <playername>.<wait><page>
We'll be holding the Spring Derby at 10:00 AM sharp in
the Plaza tomorrow.<wait><page>
How about entering the horse on your farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0029]
Enter
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0030]
Don't Enter
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0031]
Oh, wonderful! I'm so glad you'll be joining.<wait><page>
I'll take <myhorsename> with me, then.<wait><page>
The Spring Derby starts at 10:00 AM tomorrow, so don't
be late!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0032]
Oh, what a shame... There's still fun to be had, though.
You can also buy tickets and win prizes!<wait><page>
Do come and check things out tomorrow. Things will get
underway at 10:00 AM. I hope to see you there!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0033]
I tend to get a little worked up over horse races,
but I can't help it. They're just so exciting!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0034]
You entered the race, huh? Good luck! I'll be cheering
you on, so do your best.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0035]
Did you buy any tickets? I bought a ton!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0036]
I can't wait to see your race. Good luck!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0037]
Gray wanted t'come, but as soon as Gramps found out,
he stopped him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0038]
Hey, you're gonna be in the saddle today, right? Good luck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0039]
I can't even imagine riding a horse. Everyone in the race
sure is brave.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0040]
Try not to get hurt, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0041]
I know how to pick a winner, all right. My guesses are
almost always on the money. Lucky me! ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0042]
I expect great things outta you, so you better do
your best!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0043]
I'm glad it's sunny today. And there's such a wonderful
breeze!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0044]
Give it your best shot, now!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0045]
Whenever this event comes around, I get so excited
I can't sleep a wink.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0046]
If you're going to enter, you better aim for first place!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0047]
Horses from Yodel Ranch are in the race too,
didja know? Other folks'll be riding them, though.<wait><page>
Seems like a lotta people participate in this event.
I even heard old Mugi used to race!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0048]
Give it all you got! But not so much that you get hurt!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0049]
Here you can buy tickets and exchange medals for prizes.<wait><page>
And if you want to start the race, just come and talk
to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0050]
Even those participating in the race can buy tickets.
Everyone just bets on themselves, though. Ho ho ho.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0051]
Did you remember to buy some tickets? The mayor is
selling them if you're interested.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0052]
I bet on you, so you had better win!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0053]
I have the worst luck when it comes to horse racing.
I guess betting based on looks doesn't work.
But I don't know how else to pick a winner...
It's a festival, so you're supposed to have fun,
but it's just so frustrating!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0054]
Oh, <playername>! I heard you're going to be
in the race. Naturally, I bet on you. Do your best 
to leave the competition in the dust! If someone
I knew were in every race, I'd never have to agonize
over who to bet on again. Oh, but I didn't put money
on you just because of that. I believe in your skills too,
of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0055]
The races are also an opportunity to see the horses
everyone has raised. It's another reason I like this event.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0056]
You're in the race, right? Good luck. I'll be rooting for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0057]
Horses are amazing creatures. I admire their
single-minded pursuit of victory as they race.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0058]
I heard you entered the race. Believe in everything you've
done, and become one with your horse. Victory will follow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0059]
There're lots of horsies here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0060]
<myhorsename> is gonna run, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0061]
I always look forward to this event.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0062]
Oh, so you're in today's race? Just relax. A calm spirit will
ride to victory.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0063]
The races are officially over, and everyone's gone home.
What a marvelous day.<wait><page>
I'll be staying behind to clean up, so if you want to
exchange medals for prizes, just come talk to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0064]
Do you want to exchange medals for prizes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0065]
Exchange medals
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0066]
Never mind
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0067]
You'd like to exchange some medals, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0068]
I'm afraid I can't give you any prizes while you're
carrying something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0069]
All finished?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0070]
My, what a wonderful race.
Congratulations, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0071]
Hello, <playername>.<wait><page>
We're going to hold the Cooking Exhibition at 10:00 AM
in the Plaza tomorrow.<wait><page>
You can participate by bringing some of your own
culinary creations. I hope to see you there!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0072]
Mom, you don't have to worry about it so much.
Don't overdo it, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0073]
What kind of food should I make? Hmmm...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0074]
Yo, <playername>. You cookin' anythin' for the
exhibition?<wait><page>
If you are, it'd better be somethin' good.<wait><page>
Bon Vivant's the judge, after all. You won't be able t'win
with just any kinda food!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0075]
I came because I heard Lillia was entering.<wait><page>
Now I'll be right on hand in case she needs emergency
treatment.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0076]
The theme is a strange value
<string0>. It's not delicious at all.
Please report this bug.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0077]
The theme of this exhibition is
'beverages.' I expect you all
to squeeze out some great flavors today.<wait><page>
Please prepare something in keeping with the theme.
I will only judge freshly prepared dishes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0078]
The theme of this exhibition is 'sweets.' I want treats
that will tantalize your inner child!<wait><page>
Please prepare something in keeping with the theme.
I will only judge freshly prepared dishes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0079]
The theme of this exhibition is 'bread.' I hope you will all
rise to the occasion.<wait><page>
Please prepare something in keeping with the theme.
I will only judge freshly prepared dishes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0080]
The theme of this exhibition is 'udon.' I expect oodles
of springy noodles!<wait><page>
Please prepare something in keeping with the theme.
I will only judge freshly prepared dishes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0081]
The theme of this exhibition is 'rice.' I crave variety,
so steam, boil, or fry your way to victory!<wait><page>
Please prepare something in keeping with the theme.
I will only judge freshly prepared dishes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0082]
Hmmm... What should I make?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0083]
I wonder what the theme will be this time?<wait><page>
Well, Karen's going to enter no matter what it is...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0084]
I'll win first place and show everyone just how good my
cooking is. My Inn's reputation is riding on this!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0085]
I'm gonna do my best today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0086]
Today's exhibition will be simply scrumptious! I can't wait
to see what kinds of food will be featured.<wait><page>
Once you find out the theme from Bon Vivant, return
home and prepare a dish.<wait><page>
Even if you don't prepare anything, you can still watch
the event by returning here.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0087]
Oh, you entered too? What are you going to make?
I can cook almost anything, but the more effort you put
into a dish, the better it tastes. Don't you think so?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0088]
I love this festival. The marriage of cooking and
community is humbling to behold.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0089]
I'm lookin' real forward to this. When this time of year
rolls around I get so excited I can hardly wait.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0090]
I wonder if Mom'll be all right...
She was so enthusiastic, I couldn't stop her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0091]
My goodness! Such a large crowd of people makes this
very exciting, indeed. What fun!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0092]
Lillia's food is amazin'. I've never tasted anythin' like it!
She's a real treasure, that woman.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0093]
A menu that takes healthy foods into consideration
is best. Though, that's hard to do with just one dish.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0094]
The fiery passion everyone shares for cooking is so
strong I can almost taste it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0095]
*sigh* I sure have a long way to go when it comes
to cooking...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0096]
I've been trying to teach Karen how to cook,
but it's not going very well.<wait><page>
Why is she so adamant about entering the
Cooking Exhibition, I wonder?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0097]
With today's line-up of entrants, I'll have to pull out all
the stops.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0098]
Most of the food I make tends to be real simple stuff.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0099]
<playername>, did you bring any food?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0100]
Yes
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0101]
No
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0102]
It looks like you didn't bring a dish for this year's theme.
That's too bad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0103]
Then please place your entry on the table. The one Bon
Vivant deems most delicious will be crowned the winner.<wait><page>
Are you ready to start the judging?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0104]
Yes
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0105]
No
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0106]
Excellent. Bon Vivant will now begin.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0107]
Oh? Come talk to me again when you're ready
to begin, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0108]
Then please sit back and enjoy the show. Are you ready
for the judging to begin?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0109]
Are you ready for the judging to begin?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0110]
Hmmm. I'm afraid we can't start the judging if you're
carrying something. Could you please put it away?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0111]
My goal when I'm cooking is to create a homey, motherly
flavor. I've made these dishes a thousand times,
so I'm pretty confident.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0112]
Many people bring food for the event, but they're all
so distinctive. It's easy to tell who made what.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0113]
I eat my own terrible cookin' every single day, which is
why I really look forward to this event.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0114]
This screen should show the bench and dishes.<wait><page>
However, those cannot be displayed at the present time.
Apologies for the inconvenience.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0115]
The Cooking Exhibition will now enter the judging stage!<wait><page>
Please come up when your name is called.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0116]
Now then, first up is...Dudley!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0117]
You've used a variety of ingredients, and blended them
together perfectly. Absolutely delectable!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0118]
This smooth texture puts it in perfect harmony with the
caramel sauce.<wait><page>
It's decadent and delicious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0119]
Freshly baked bread and spicy curry really rouses
the appetite. Mmmmm, wonderful!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0120]
The more I eat this udon, the more bursting with energy
I become! What a treat!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0121]
Fried rice may seem simple, but this dish has a lot
of depth.<wait><page>
It's no easy feat to reach this level of perfection.
Quite the accomplishment.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0122]
Next is Ran!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0123]
Hmmm. Using milk makes the overall flavor
mild but very pleasant.<wait><page>
This is a good dish.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0124]
Yes... This has the perfect level of sweetness.<wait><page>
People of all ages should be able to enjoy this.
It's delightful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0125]
The flavors of the ingredients harmonize with each other
very well. It has the perfect amount of sweetness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0126]
You've done well at bringing out the full flavor of the
udon and tempura. How very scrumptious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0127]
Mmmm, yes. Very good. The eggs and rice go well
together. Children would love this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0128]
Next is Lillia!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0129]
This has a very fresh, fruity taste that cleanses
the palate. Well done.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0130]
The entire cake is moist and has an exquisite flavor. <wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0131]
The sweet and sour balance of the bread and the grapes
blends perfectly in the mouth.<wait><page>
How delightful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0132]
The spiciness of the curry and the way the noodles slide
down the throat is just wonderful.<wait><page>
Mouth-wateringly good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0133]
There's a richness hidden amidst all the spice.
I'm impressed. This is very tasty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0134]
Next is Manna!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0135]
You made a very palatable vegetable juice with a good
combination of ingredients. Marvelous.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0136]
This entry has just the right touch of sweetness.
The texture is very smooth too. This is a quality dish.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0137]
The balance of sweet and sour from the orange is great.
It goes well with the bread.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0138]
Hmmm. A simple flavor that hides surprising depth.
This is delicious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0139]
The texture of the bamboo and the seasoning of the rice
are well-matched. An inspired pairing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0140]
Last is Karen!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0141]
Next is Karen!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0142]
Wh-What... What is this? I-I haven't the words to
describe what I've tasted here...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0143]
I-Is this some kind of joke? I refrain from commenting.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0144]
Hmmm... I can't quite find the words to express
this flavor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0145]
It has no body to it, so I don't feel like I've eaten anything.
Good...attempt.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0146]
It's...onigiri. Plain onigiri. It's edible.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0147]
Bon Vivant has tasted all of the contestants' entries.<wait><page>
He will now decide the winner, so please give him
a moment.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0148]
Last is <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0149]
Th-This is...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0150]
It tastes...extraordinary. Absolutely extraordinary!<wait><page>
Even some professionals could not bring out such flavor.
What a pleasant surprise!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0151]
Delicious!<wait><page>
Have you considered becoming a chef? I can't remember
the last time I tasted something this good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0152]
Mmmm, yes. This is certainly some fine home cooking.
It's very good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0153]
Hmmm... It feels like...it might be missing something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0154]
I will refrain from commenting. Urp...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0155]
This dish does not match the theme. You are disqualified!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0156]
The winner will now be announced. Please come up when
your name is called. And the winner is...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0157]
<playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0158]
Dudley!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0159]
Ran!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0160]
Lillia!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0161]
Manna!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0162]
That was truly scrumptious. I congratulate you from the
bottom of my stomach.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0163]
That was fun! It's about time I got back to work, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0164]
Yo. Sorry t'bother you so early, <playername>.<wait><page>
We're havin' our grand Fetch Fest tomorrow, so I came
to invite you and your pet. Wanna join in?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0165]
At the Fetch Fest, we have a disc tournament with our
pets. You gonna enter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0166]
Huh? Your pet's not fully grown yet? Too bad.
You can't join in, then.<wait><page>
Well, even if you can't participate, come on by and watch
if you're free.<wait><page>
The Fetch Fest'll be at the beach, 10:00 AM tomorrow.
Hope t'see you there!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0167]
All right! I'll take them, then.<wait><page>
Don't worry. They're in good hands.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0168]
Huh... Too bad. Well, come by to watch if you've got any
free time.<wait><page>
The Fetch Fest'll be at the beach, 10:00 AM tomorrow.
Hope t'see you there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0169]
Hee hee! All the pets are sooo cute! ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0170]
You're participating, right? Good luck!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0171]
Pets are really smart. I wouldn't mind having one at
home, myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0172]
You entered?
Wow. Good luck out there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0173]
Some animals are quite clever, especially pets. If you
train them, they can do lots of different things.<wait><page>
Hmmm. Maybe we should get a pet, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0174]
You're taking part, right? Do your best!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0175]
I've always been particularly fond of this holiday.
Watching everyone's pets chase the disc with all their
might is so charming.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0176]
Oh, you're joining in? Wonderful. I'll be cheering you on.
Good luck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0177]
I was wondering what all the ruckus was
outside the Cafe. A fetch contest, huh?<wait><page>
So it's a tournament where pets compete to catch a
flying disc. Neat!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0178]
Oh, you've entered, huh? Well, I'll be watching, then.
Do your best, you hear?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0179]
Ever since I started the tournament, the Fetch Fest's
been somethin' I look forward to every year.<wait><page>
I know all the pets that've entered.<wait><page>
My work as a shipper has me go to a buncha houses,
after all. I'll be happy no matter who wins.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0180]
Go for first place! You got this!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0181]
We ready t'kick off the Fetch Fest tournament?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0182]
Let's do it!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0183]
Wait a minute.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0184]
All right! Let's get this show on the road!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0185]
Okay. When you're good to go, just lemme know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0186]
The Fetch Fest was a huge success.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Contest organizers will bring the entered pets back to

I repeat, the Fetch Fest is now over.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0188]
Awww. You were sooooo close. I hope you win next year!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0189]
Woohoo! Awesome! You won! ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0190]
The pets were all super cuuute! ∀ I want one too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0191]
That was so close. I think even just participating is
pretty amazing, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0192]
Congratulations! Just what I'd expect from someone who
works on a farm. You've got a real way with animals.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0193]
Animals really are clever. I'm even more sure of that now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0194]
That's too bad. I'm sure you'll win next year if you work
hard, though. Don't let it get you down.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0195]
My goodness! What a victory. I'm as happy as if I'd won
myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0196]
After watching that performance, I'm really impressed
with all of the animals. Maybe we should seriously
consider getting a pet...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0197]
Oh no! That's a shame. But your pet did their very best,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0198]
Congratulations, <playername>! I had a hunch that
you'd win.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0199]
What fun that was. Our community spirit always shines
brightly on festivals like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0200]
Hey, too bad, huh? But don't let it bother you. Just give it
another go next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0201]
After seeing you in action, you totally deserved it.
Congrats on your win!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0202]
Did you see that? Amazing, right?! Pets sure can do all
kinds of things.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0203]
Well, don't be discouraged. You should try again next
year. I'll be rootin' for ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0204]
Great job! You musta practiced a lot, huh?<wait><page>
Join in again next year and get a winnin' streak going.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0205]
This year was a blast again. You should join in next year.
I'll root for ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

You could cheer on the other chickens, though, so come on
by the Plaza. I promise it'll be fun.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0221]
Great! Then I'll take <string0> now
and look after her until the festival's over.<wait><page>
The Cluck-Cluck Clash is tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM,
so don't miss it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0222]
If you're confident about winning, you miiight want to
leave some space in your Bag.<wait><page>
We can't give you a trophy if your Bag's full,
and I wouldn't want you to miss out!<wait><page>
That being said, are you ready to start the
Cluck-Cluck Clash?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0223]
Let the feathers fly!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0224]
Not yet.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0225]
Ah, I'm afraid you can't use anything to help your chicken.
Any items you're holding should be put away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0226]
All right! Release...the chickens!!!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0227]
Okay. When you're ready, just talk to me and we'll begin.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0228]
Oh, you're participating? That's great! This festival's
really funny!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0229]
Chickens are sooo cute!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0230]
This is a festival I look forward to every year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0231]
If you're going to enter, then I eggs-pect you
to do your best.<wait><page>
...I've been waiting all year to use that pun.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0232]
I'll be watching the festival from here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0233]
Hello, <playername>. Good luck out there.
May your chicken be ruler of the roost.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0234]
Oh, if it isn't <playername>. The Cluck-Cluck Clash
is a proper tournament, you know. We take it very
seriously.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0235]
I wish you luck in the battle ahead.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0236]
Don't you think we could learn a thing or two from the
way the chickens fight with all their might? What noble
birds.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0237]
I'm going to watch those chickens. Watch and learn. <wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0238]
The Cluck-Cluck Clash is a real hoot. Or should I say
"cluck"?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0239]
Are your farm's chickens strong, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0240]
This year's battle of the birds had a lot of highlights.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0241]
Hey, <string0> is really strong.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0242]
That's too bad. But there's no room for paltry poultry at
this festival.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0243]
That was so much fun. Chickens are adorable! ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0244]
Wooow! Good for you. Maybe it'll start laying Golden
Eggs soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0245]
Aww, that was close, huh? When that happens, there's
just not much you can do about it, though. Cheer up!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0246]
So that chicken won, after all. Just as I thought.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0247]
I knew your chicken would make it far!<wait><page>
How did I know, you ask? Because it lays delicious
eggs, of course!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0248]
Huh. Was it not feeling well? That was the most
powerful bird on the farm, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0249]
What a fabulous contest. Truly inspiring. You should have
participated, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0250]
Well done! You should have <string0>
participate again next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0251]
This year's festival was amazing.
There's nothing quite like pitting chickens
against one another in a bid for glory.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0252]
Phew. I got tired just watching them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0253]
Hey, hey, hey! That's phenomenal! You must be proud
to have such a fine feathered friend.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0254]
What a shame... Perhaps it would perform better if you
gave it a bit more attention.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0255]
The feathers were flying, the beaks were snapping,
and I've never heard such a ruckus! I had a rip-roaring
time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0256]
Of course you're proud.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0257]
Mmm, you did your best.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0258]
Hmmm... That was quite the clash. Yes, indeedy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0259]
Those chickens gave their all. I enjoyed watching it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0260]
Is your chicken all right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0261]
The Cluck-Cluck Clash is now over.<wait><page>
Festival organizers will bring the entered chickens back
to their homes, so owners should go on ahead and return.<wait><page>
I repeat, the Cluck-Cluck Clash is now over.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0262]
Congratulations on winning!<wait><page>
That was impressive. There aren't many people
who could raise such powerful poultry.<wait><page>
It was a great match.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0263]
Good morning, <playername>. We're holding our
annual Moo-Moo Festival tomorrow.<wait><page>
Any adult cow can participate as long as it's not
pregnant.<wait><page>
I'm hoping <myfarmname> can participate next year,
but come watch if you like.<wait><page>
It'll start 10:00 AM sharp at Rose Plaza. Hope to see you
there tomorrow, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0264]
Good morning, <playername>. We're holding our
annual Moo-Moo Festival tomorrow.<wait><page>
Any adult cow can participate if it's not pregnant.<wait><page>
By next year, <myfarmname>'s animals should be old
enough to participate, but come watch if you like.<wait><page>
It'll start 10:00 AM sharp at Rose Plaza. Hope to see you
there tomorrow, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0265]
Good morning, <playername>. The Moo-Moo Festival
is tomorrow at Rose Plaza. Pretty exciting, right?<wait><page>
What do you think about entering an adult cow from
<myfarmname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0266]
Enter
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0267]
Don't enter
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0268]
Then which cow will you enter?<wait><page>
Any cow that's producing milk is fine, but pregnant cows
aren't allowed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0269]
That's too bad. I thought it would be more exciting to
have a cow from your farm join in too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0270]
We'll be putting on the Moo-Moo Festival at the Plaza
tomorrow. Come watch, if you'd like.<wait><page>
Any adult cow can be entered if it's not pregnant, but...<wait><page>
...it doesn't look like you have any cows that can
participate.<wait><page>
Well, catch you later, <playername>.
Hope to see you tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0271]
Okey-doke. Then I'll take <string0>
with me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0272]
These are some fine cows. They're all pretty cute.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0273]
Hey, is a cow from your farm participating,
<playername>? Good luck! I hope you win.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0274]
Hey, is a cow from your farm participating,
<playername>? Good luck! I hope you win.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0275]
A cow from our farm is participating, right,
<nickname>? We're bound to win! I'll be rooting
from the sidelines!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0276]
I finally started to be able to stomach milk recently.
I used to hate it, but it tastes good now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0277]
I hope you win!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0278]
Your cow's just gotta win, <nickname>. Good luck!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0279]
Hey, <nickname>. You should drink milk every day,
you know. It's good for your health.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0280]
Hey, <playername>. You should drink milk every day,
you know. It's good for your health.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0281]
Oh, so your cow is participating too.
Do you think you'll win?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0282]
Hey, your cow is participating too, right,
<nickname>? I'll be cheering you on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0283]
There, there. Good girl. Ah ha ha ha, I love nature.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0284]
The cow from your farm looks splendid,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0285]

<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0286]
It's so wonderful to have a chance to interact with
animals from a young age.<wait><page>
Some kids have never even touched a dog or cat before
because their parents hate animals.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0287]
I'll be cheering you on. Good luck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0288]
I'll be cheering you on, <nickname>. Good luck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0289]
Hmmm. They all look very robust. Which cow do you think
is the best?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0290]
I'm so glad you entered. I can't wait to see
your cow in action.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0291]
Hee hee, they're all so cute. The way they just stare into
space while they're eating is adorable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0292]
Your cow will do just fine. It's sure to win.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0293]
Wooow, they're so big! Would I be flattened like
a pancake if one stepped on me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0294]
Your cow looks real strong.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0295]
Your cow looks real strong.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0296]
Cows are treated very differently depending on what
country you live in.<wait><page>
But they're hard workers and produce milk, so they're
generally appreciated.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0297]
Are you taking good care of your cow?<wait><page>
If you don't shower it with love, it won't become the best
cow it can be.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0298]
The cows from our ranch aren't gonna join in.<wait><page>
When I asked why, Grandpa said something about
"imparshality."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0299]
A cow from your farm is gonna be in it, yeah?
I'll cheer for you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0300]
A cow from your farm is gonna be in it, yeah?
I'll cheer for you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0301]
Cows, hmm? I came because I thought they might give me
some new kind of inspiration.<wait><page>
And, indeed... Their slab-like design, the roughness of their
hide, their spotty coloring, their empty eyes... Fascinating!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0302]
I think it's about time we crowned the winning cow.
Ah, but a word of advice: be sure to leave some space
in your Bag!<wait><page>
After all, if you've got a full Bag and your cow is the
victor, we won't be able to give you your trophy.<wait><page>
Now, then, are you ready?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0303]
Start the judging.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0304]
Then we'll get going.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0305]
Talk to me when you're ready to begin, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0306]
The Moo-Moo Festival is now over.<wait><page>

their homes, so owners should go on ahead and return.<wait><page>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0307]
I knew that cow would win. I could see the determination
in its eyes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0308]
Your cow had a different look in its eyes. I really thought
it would win.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0309]
Can't win 'em all. You should try again next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0310]
They're all sooo adorable! ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0311]
Congrats! ♪ I knew you'd win.<wait><page>
How'd I know? Oh, I just kinda had a hunch.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0312]
Awww, that's sad. But <string0> did
her best.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0313]
If a cow steps on your foot, don't try to force it off.
You might break a bone.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0314]
<string0>'s milk seems to have a lot
of nutrients. Would you let me try some sometime?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0315]
That's unfortunate. <string0>'s coat
seems quite nice, though, so I'm sure it'll win next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0316]
Ha ha ha ha! It licked my whole face. I'm all slimy now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0317]
It was quite the feat to edge out those other cows.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0318]
Participating is what's most important, so don't be so
discouraged.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0319]
It was so happy when I brushed it. That made me happy
too. What a fun day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0320]
Congratulations! <myfarmname> sure produces some
real winners.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0321]
All the cows here today were incredible. I think you did
a great job.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0322]
What a marvelous showcase we had today. It was a good
opportunity to see a lot of other cows, wasn't it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0323]
Congratulations on winning! I feel so proud to be a part
of this town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0324]
Don't fret, <playername>. It was a close competition.
Don't be discouraged from entering again next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0325]
Ugh. Yu, that little troublemaker... He causes mischief no
matter where we go.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0326]
Congratulations. All the love and care you gave it really
showed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0327]
Oh, so you didn't win. If you give it love and care every
day, I'm sure you'll win next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0328]
I tried to ride on a cow, but Elly got mad at me.<wait><page>
I just wanted to talk with it, though...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0329]
Wow! You won! Congrats! Lemme ride the winning cow
sometime!<wait>

[0333]
My dream is to sleep while reclining on a cow.
With a straw hat covering my face, of course.
Ah, sweet bovine bliss.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0334]
So you won. Congratulations! I praise your efforts.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0335]
That's unfortunate. I prayed for your victory, but...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0336]
Cows are nice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0337]
Wow! Good job! I'm so happy for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

We had a lot of great cows this year. Yes, siree.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0342]
Be sure to keep taking good care of your animals.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0343]
Hrmmm. Well, that's disappointing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0344]
All of the cows have such fascinating patterns.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0345]
You won? Congratulations. I don't know what criteria
they used, but personally, I think your cow is a wonderful
specimen.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0346]
You lost? You must be terribly disappointed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0347]
And so, the winner is...
<myfarmname>'s <string0>!<wait><page>
Its coat is glossy, and it's a very amiable cow. Well done!<wait>

[0348]
Man, this year's Fireworks Festival is really something.
The big displays are nice, and I really like the sparklers
too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0349]
Dude, fireworks are so exciting! I'm a positive guy to
begin with, but the Fireworks Festival REALLY puts me
in a great mood!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0350]
The boom of the fireworks is so loud that I can feel it
echoing in my chest.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0351]
Wow...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0352]
Fireworks come in little tubes, but when you shoot 'em,
they explode into all these big shapes and colors.<wait><page>
I wonder how they work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0353]
Isn't it wonderful how one can simply turn off one's
brain and enjoy the spectacle of fireworks against
the night sky?<wait><page>
What a luxury it is to enjoy a thing of beauty simply
for itself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0354]
Aah...! Glittering flowers of light filling the sky from end
to end... The pyrotechnicians have created true art.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0355]
I love how fireworks just pop and change, and then
BOOM! They fade so fast you can't tear your eyes away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0356]
I wonder how fireworks can have all those different
colors inside those little tubes.<wait><page>
And why do they always seem to be the same shape,
no matter where I look at them from?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0357]
One night a year, the sky goes from dark to bursting with
light and sound.<wait><page>
I wonder what all the sea creatures think of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0358]
Another town I lived in had lots of fireworks displays.
Parades, New Year's, festivals... It was always going
boom, boom, boom!<wait><page>
Of all the fireworks I've seen, I think the ones from this
shoreline are the prettiest, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0359]
How beautiful... When I was little I was afraid
of fireworks. I don't remember why, but I thought
they were scary back then.<wait><page>
I think it was because it felt like they were falling
towards me. Don't you get that feeling when you
look at them?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0360]
A grand pulse of man-made energy and sound that shakes
you down to your very soul.<wait><page>
It's an experience one can have only on a night like this.
Isn't it splendiferous?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0361]
This year's Fireworks Festival was great. Let's come
and watch it again next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0362]
Aw, over already?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0363]
I had a blast! I definitely have to come see this again
next year!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0364]
Welp, that's it. It's over. I hope we can watch it together
again next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0365]
That's it, I guess. And the next one isn't till next year.
It's gonna be hard to wait that long, huh?<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0366]
Bravo! What a wonderful display that was! I haven't the
words to describe how much I enjoyed it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0367]
I think I'd like to make a piece someday that expresses
the emotions I experienced tonight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0368]
Wasn't the finale amazing? I could hear everyone ooh-ing
and aah-ing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0369]
Aww, it's over. I'd love to sit and just bask in how much
fun it all was, but I guess we'd better go home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0370]
Ahahaha... I was looking up for so long that I got a crick
in my neck. Ouch. I think I'd better go home and rest.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0371]
That was really fun. Let's watch it together again
next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0372]
Ahhh, that was great. Now that I've had this nice break,
I feel recharged. I'll be ready to give my best at work
again tomorrow!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0373]
That was an entirely satisfactory evening. I will sleep
well tonight under a blanket of stars.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0374]
Watching fireworks from the beach is the best.
It just feels so magical.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0377]
I come here every year to watch the Fireworks Festival.<wait><page>
When I was little, my whole family would come, and we'd
make a day out of it. Back then it all seemed so much
bigger to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0378]
The show's about to start. Do you need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0379]
Should I invite them to watch the
Fireworks Festival with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0380]
Yes
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0381]
No
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0382]
You want to watch the fireworks together? Sure!
That sounds great.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0383]
<nickname>, you came. How about we sit and
watch the fireworks together?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0384]
Oh! Hi, <playername>! I've been looking forward to
tonight aaall day! Is the show gonna start soon?
I can't wait!<wait>

[0386]
Ooh! Ooh! This spot is perfect, don't you think?
We'll be able to see them really well from here!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0387]
Yep, sure! Ah, it looks like they'll be starting soon.
Exciting!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0388]
Oh! Hi, <nickname>! ∀ The fireworks are gonna
start soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0389]
I can't wait for the show to start.<wait><page>
I like fireworks a lot. My old hometown used to have
these kinds of displays.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0390]
I'm really starting to get excited now... I hope the show
kicks off soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0391]
Huh? You want to watch the Fireworks Festival with
me? Um...sure, I guess.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0392]
Oh, hey. <nickname>, look. The view from here
is pretty nice, right? Do you want to sit and watch
with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0393]
Ah, hello, <playername>. You came to watch too?<wait><page>
Mineral Town's Fireworks Festival is particularly
lovely. I suggest you get comfortable and prepare
to be wowed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0394]
It ought to begin shortly. Get ready,
<playername>. You're in for a real treat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0395]
You'd like to watch the Fireworks Festival with me?
Of course. I don't mind at all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0396]
Ah, <nickname>. You've come too? Come.
Let's enjoy the show together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0397]
Nothing like relaxing on a summer's night with a glass
of wine. *gulp* Time for another!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0398]
*giggle* Summer's just the best. There's the Fireworks
Festival to look forward to, and lots of good food, too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0399]
What's up? Looking for someone to watch the Fireworks
Festival with?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0400]
Sure! I'd love to watch it with you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0401]
Oh, hey, <nickname>. All done with work
for the day?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0402]
Great! We can watch the fireworks together.
Here, sit next to me. C'mon, scooch a little closer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0403]
Woohoo! The fireworks show is gonna be great!
They always set off a whole bunch at once at
the end. It's gonna be amazing!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0404]
Do you know where you wanna sit to watch
the fireworks? It'll be a waste if you don't find
just the right spot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0405]
Oh, c'mon. You don't have to be so formal about it.
I'd love to watch the fireworks with you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0406]
<nickname>! It's about time you got here.
Hurry, they're about to start!
C'mon, we can watch from here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0407]
Good evening. I think the fireworks display
is about to begin.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0408]
I wonder what kind of show they're going to put on for us
this year? I can't wait to find out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0409]
Yes, of course. I'd love to watch the fireworks together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0410]
Oh, there you are, <nickname>. Let's watch the
fireworks together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0411]
Good evening, <playername>. I'm so glad you made it
in time for the fireworks show.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0412]
Good evening, <playername>. I'm so glad you made it
in time for the fireworks show.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0413]
I think it ought to start soon. Is something the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0414]
You want to watch the fireworks show together?
Of course. I'd love to.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0415]
Oh! <nickname>, you came. I thought you were too
busy with work to make it. I'm so glad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0416]
Wonderful. We can watch the fireworks together,
after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0417]
Nothing says summer like fireworks on the beach. They
hold this festival every year, but I never get tired of it.<wait><page>
This town puts on a way better show than a lot of other
places I know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0418]
Hey, <playername>? You sure you wanna watch from
there? You've gotta find just the right spot for this kind
of thing, y'know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0419]
Sure, 'course I do! Let's watch the fireworks together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0420]
<nickname>, what're you waiting for? C'mon, we'll
watch them from here. Hurry up before they start!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0421]
Every year, Grandpa makes the cylinders used for
the fireworks.<wait><page>
There's no way to see them from here, but every year
he tells me to watch them closely. I don't get it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0422]
Isn't it time for them to start yet? Y'know, I don't think
I've met a single person who hates fireworks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0423]
Hm? O-Oh, uh, sure. We can watch the fireworks
together if you want.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0424]
<nickname>, c'mon. It's about to start. I've been
waiting all day for this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0425]
I have been awaiting tonight's events with great
anticipation for days now.<wait><page>
Has it not begun yet? When will the display get
underway?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0426]
<playername>, how long are you going to aimlessly
wander about? Best choose your spot before the glorious
view escapes you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0427]
You'd like to watch them from here? Oh, er...all right.
I don't particularly mind, I suppose.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0428]
<nickname>, you're here. Splendid. Let us soak in
the dazzling display from here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0429]
Oh, good evening. The sky is beautiful tonight, no?
So crisp and clear. We should have a lovely show.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0430]
I can feel everyone's positive energies growing with
anticipation. I believe the show will be starting soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0431]
Watching the fireworks display together with another...
Hmm. All right. That may be a source of positive energies.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0432]
My, did you sense my feelings calling out to you?
I was just thinking I might like some company.
Come, let's watch together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0433]
Good morning, <playername>. We plan to hold our
annual Concert in the Church tomorrow at 6:00 PM.<wait><page>
I came today because I'd like you to participate as
a performer. Will you join us?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

I came today because I'd like you to participate as

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0435]
Participate
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0436]
Don't participate
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0437]
You will? Wonderful. I prayed you would.<wait><page>
I'm thinking of having you play the ocarina. I'll give the
instrument to you tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0438]
Please don't be late tomorrow. Come to the Church
at 6:00 PM.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0439]
I understand. It's a shame, but you'll still be able to hear
Karen's beautiful singing voice if you attend.<wait><page>
If you have time, do come see us perform at the Church.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0440]
I've been waiting for you. Everyone's inside.
Now let's go in.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0441]
Forgive me, but we're about to have a concert,
so no outside items are allowed in the Church.<wait><page>
I'm terribly sorry, but could you set what you're holding
aside?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0442]
This is great. Music is perfect for relaxing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0443]
La la la ♪ Laaa la la ♪ Yeah, all right. I'm ready to sing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0444]
Everyone helps put this concert together. It's more fun
than having professionals come.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0445]
Even if I mess up, I'm sure Elly'll help back me up.
I'll just wing it. ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0446]
I'll be playing the organ today. Though, I'm not very
experienced. I only took a few lessons when I was
younger.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0447]
Phew, I'm so nervous. I wonder if I'll be able to play
without making any mistakes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0448]
Karen's gonna sing. She's so cool!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0449]
I was going to have you play the ocarina, correct?<wait><page>
I'm looking forward to it. Shall we begin?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0450]
Begin
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0451]
Wait
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0452]
Now then, ladies and gentlemen. Please wait a moment
while they take their places.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0453]
All right. Once you're ready, come talk to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0454]
Hmm. It will be quite difficult to play properly while
carrying something. Please put it away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0455]
You're not participating in this concert, correct?
Then please observe. I'm sure you will find it
very moving.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0456]
I wanna sing in the Concert when I grow up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0457]
I really enjoyed that. I should come again next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0458]
What a wonderful event. I can't wait till next year's.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0459]
Good morning, <playername>. Everyone will be
gathering at 10:00 AM tomorrow for the
Harvest Festival.<wait><page>
For this event, we all bring ingredients to throw into a
big pot. It's a kind of community potluck.<wait><page>
It would be wonderful if you could bring something
delicious to contribute too. I hope to see you tomorrow!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0460]
I brought something! Boy, is everyone gonna be surprised.
Hee hee!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0461]
See? Jam. I'm sure it'll help give it that extra kick.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0462]
I'll have to keep a close eye on Karen.<wait><page>
One time she threw chocolate in.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0463]
All right, don't touch the pot! Hey, don't put that
stuff in yet!<wait><page>
Ugh, that's not what the fish is for!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0464]
Argh! Enough! Quit yelling, Dad! It's all the same when
it's mixed up!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0465]
Oh my. I think people might be sneaking things in without
others knowing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0466]
It'll be nice not having to cook for a change. And tonight
we'll make our own hot pot with whatever's left over at
home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0467]
Hrmm. It seems you haven't brought anything for the pot.
If you want to participate, could you bring some kind of
food?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0468]
Hello, <playername>. Did you bring an ingredient to
add to the pot?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0469]
Yes
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0470]
No
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0471]
You'd like to add that, yes? Excellent. Let's get it in there
and start the feast.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0472]
...Is this some kind of joke? We can't put that in the pot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0473]
Hot pots are really good for you. Soup has a lot of
nutrients, you know.<wait><page>
I'll have to bring some back for Grandma.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0474]
Hot pots are really good for you. Soup has a lot nutrients,
you know.<wait><page>
I'll have to bring some back for Grandma.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0475]
Oh, <playername>. Did you bring something good?
You do run a farm, after all. I have high hopes for your
contribution.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0476]
Ah, sweet sermons, this takes me back. I used to do
something similar back in the day.<wait><page>
I would put on my holy apron and make the most divine
soup, then have the townspeople over.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0477]
Man, that looks good. Sittin' down and havin' a meal with
so many people is always a great time too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0478]
I-It wasn't me, okay? I didn't do it. The pot is jam-free,
I swear!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0479]
I...may have dropped the jam in. And the jar. 
I fished it out before anyone noticed, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0480]
*sigh* I'm sure we have Karen to thank for this...again.<wait><page>
Maybe it was candy this time. Or marshmallows?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0481]
Phew, that's a relief. It seems nothing strange made it in
this time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0482]
That's odd. I tasted it partway through and...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0483]
Obviously, it turned out amazing because I was the one
watching the pot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0484]
Awww, I was really looking forward to it too.
I'm not even close to full yet!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0485]
Uuuuugh... I ate too much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0486]
*sigh* I knew it. We should have checked each ingredient
before it went in. What a waste of food...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0487]
Now that was a feast. We must be grateful for the
blessings of the land and sea.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0488]
What in the world...? Just what kind of flavor IS this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0489]
That was absolutely delicious. Oh my...
There isn't any left.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0490]
Well, we all make it together, after all.
This does happen sometimes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0491]
Did you have fun? Eating together with so many people
is quite the experience, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0492]
Hmm? Why is everyone upset? I thought it was good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0493]
The fish stock was perfect. It really made the dish
for me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0494]
<playername>, do you have some water?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0495]
Anna threw in those herbs.
They did a great job canceling out the fishy smell.
Though, the fragrance might be a little too strong.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0496]
Well, this is part of having everyone bring ingredients.
Unpredictability is the cross we all must bear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0497]
Hot pots certainly taste better when you share them
with everyone.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0498]
No matter what it tastes like, I can't bring myself
to waste any.<wait><page>
Why? Because it's hurtful to the mountain, ocean, and
the people who made it. You make sure to eat some too,
you hear?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0499]
Well now, I've had my meal, and it was a real treat.
Time to get back to swingin' my axe!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0500]
There's supposed to be a large pot and things displayed
for this event.<wait><page>
But those can't be displayed at the present time.
Apologies for the inconvenience.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0501]
Boy, the moon sure is pretty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0502]
It really is beautiful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0503]
Whoa, this place has the best view.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0504]
Wow. The moon looks huge tonight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0505]
Aah, what a lovely moon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0506]
The pearly brilliance of the moon's light suffusing the
night sky with a gentle glow... What sublime beauty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0507]
The moon seems so close it feels like I could almost reach
out and touch it. We definitely picked the right spot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0508]
Wow... Right now, people all over the world are looking up
at the moon, just like us.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0509]
Man, now that's one huge moon! They say there's a
rabbit living up there, you know. I wonder if that's true.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0510]
Of all the phases of the moon, it's the coolest when
it's full. That's when it shows us its true face.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0511]
There's something mystical about the moon this evening.
It's the same moon as always, but somehow tonight is
special.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0512]
Tonight, we see the moon as a perfect circle. The other
phases all have their charms, but the full moon is special...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0513]
Ooh! Moon dumplings. Mind if I have some?<wait><page>
Woohoo! Thanks! *munch* *munch* *munch*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0514]
Mmmmm! Thanks! Those were really good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0515]
Oh...moon dumplings? Did you make these just for me?
O-Oh, um, th-thank you...<wait><page>
I-Is it okay if I taste one? Thanks... *munch* *munch*
*munch*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0516]
Mmm. Those were great. Eating moon dumplings while
watching the moon... It really makes tonight something
special.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0517]
What, you made moon dumplings for me? Aww, thanks!
That's so cool of you!<wait><page>
Heh heh, don't mind if I do! *munch* *munch* *munch*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0518]
Mmm! Those really hit the spot. Man, getting to have
tasty moon dumplings while watching the moon is the
way to go. Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0519]
Huh? Oh, moon dumplings. You made these for me?<wait><page>
Thanks. *munch* *munch* *munch*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0520]
Yum. Those were pretty good. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0521]
Oh ho! Moon dumplings! Did you make them especially for
tonight? How very thoughtful.<wait><page>
Why, thank you. *munch* *munch* *munch*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0522]
Mmm. They were absolutely delicious. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0523]
And those are...? Ah, I see. "Moon dumplings."
How fanciful.<wait><page>
What, I'm to eat these? ...I suppose I could try one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0524]
Well, color me surprised. They're quite good. Still, eating
dumplings while observing the moon? What an unusual
custom.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0525]
I wonder if Mom and Dad used to come and watch the
moon like this. I wish... I wish he'd come home soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0526]
Looking up at the moon on a night like this puts you
in a mood that's hard to describe... Or is it just me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0527]
The moon's pretty impressive as-is, but I think it's even
cooler-looking with wisps of cloud floating across it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0528]
I don't usually bother staring at the moon, but taking
some time to relax and give it a look ain't half bad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0529]
I could gaze at the moon like this all night long. Let's hope
we're blessed with good weather again next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0530]
Which do you prefer, the full moon or the shifting phases
of waxing and waning?<wait><page>
No, never mind. The beauteous faces of the moon are
something that just cannot be compared.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0531]
Staying up late isn't so bad every once in a while.
I hope I can make it till dawn, though...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0532]
Whoops! I stayed up all night. I hope my eyes don't get
too puffy...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0533]
It's so pretty...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0534]
Wooow. The moon is super round. And huge!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0535]
Ooh, it's so beautiful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0536]
Beautiful...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0537]
It's really pretty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0538]
On a night like tonight I can feel the tug of the moon's
natural energies...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0539]
Isn't this the best? You won't find a better view than
from here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0540]
Boy, it looks really, REALLY big from here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0541]
Y'know what? It's so round that it looks like a big ol' ball.
Or a dumpling. Mmmmm...dumplings.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0542]
The moon truly is a strange and mystic thing.
Sometimes, I wonder...<wait><page>
Without the moon, what would the world be like?
Some place entirely different, I'm sure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0543]
I really love the moon. You've seen it when it's all wispy
and white in the morning, right? It's awfully cute
then too.<wait>

I can feel the moon's pure energies suffusing my very
soul... Can you feel it too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0545]
It's weird. How come the moon looks so
beautiful? It's just the same old moon, right?
Why's it different this one night?<wait>

It feels like we're on a totally different world sitting
under this moon.<wait>

If I jump, I think I could just about reach it. Look, see?
I can almost touch it right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Mama and Papa said they'd be coming out tonight too.
I wonder if they found a different spot to sit.<wait><page>
Actually, it might just be Papa. Mama doesn't like the
mountain at night.<wait>

The moon is so bright it's almost as light as day.<wait><page>
On nights like this, don't you just want to stay up
all night long?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

It's said the pure energies of the moon can have great
and mystical effects on both humans and nature.<wait><page>
Looking up at the moon tonight, I think I can
understand why.<wait>

in your Bag!<wait><page>
After all, if you've got a full Bag and your animal is the
victor, we won't be able to give you your trophy.<wait><page>

[0735]
Good morning, <playername>. I have some letters
for you. <string0>, in fact.<wait><page>
I'm delivering them in person because it is most important
that you read them today.<wait><page>
I'll be needing a reply to them from you, as well.
Let me know when you've read them, all right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0736]
Whose letter should I read first?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0737]
Well, <playername>? Will you accept the invitation?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0738]
Accept
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0739]
Decline
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0740]
Read another letter.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0741]
I see. Well, I shall pass your message along, then.
Good day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0742]
Are you going to spend this year's Starlight Night
on your own, then?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0743]
Yes
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0744]
No
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0745]
I see. I shall pass your message along, then. I'm sure he'll
be overjoyed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0746]
I see. I shall pass your message along, then. I'm sure she'll
be overjoyed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0747]
Ah! You came!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0748]
My, my! Good evening, sweetie. Come on in.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0749]
Hey. I heard Popuri invited you tonight.<wait><page>
I was actually wondering what you'd be doing for tonight
too, seeing as you live alone and stuff.<wait><page>
Starlight Night is just better spent together with friends
and family, don't you think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0750]
So yeah. Today I get to spend together with my family
and my spouse. 'Kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0751]
All right, everyone. Let's get started!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0752]
I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together with
Popuri and her family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0753]
Oh, hey! You came! Come on in! We were just about
to get started.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0754]
You know, you don't have to wait for a special occasion.
Come on by whenever! In fact, I insist!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0755]
You know, you don't have to wait for a special occasion.
Come on by whenever! In fact, I insist!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0756]
Ugh. There he goes again. Dad! Keep that up and
<playername> won't ever come to visit again!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0757]
Ugh. There he goes again. Dad! Keep that up and
<playername> won't ever come to visit again!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0758]
I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together with
Ran and her family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0759]
Oh, good evening. Your timing is perfect. We were just
about to get started.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0760]
I'm so glad you could come. It's always the more the
merrier with parties like these.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0761]
Doctor is having dinner with Carter at the Church again
this year. They aaaaalways do that.<wait><page>
And they aaaaalways say Elly can't come with, too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0762]
Yu! Goodness, child. Why did you have to bring that
up now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0763]
I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together with
Elly and her family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0764]
Ah! <playername>! There you are!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0765]
Ah! <playername>! There you are!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0766]
Karen was pacing a rut into the floor, breathlessly
waiting for your arrival, dear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0767]
Wait... "Breathlessly"?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0768]
Um...what did you mean by that?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0769]
Oh, nothing.<wait><page>
I was just saying that <playername> might come and
join us today, since they live alone. That's all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0770]
Oh, nothing.<wait><page>
I was just saying that <playername> might come and
join us today, since they live alone. That's all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0771]
I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together with
Karen and her family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0772]
Oh. You came.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0773]
My, my! Good evening. Please come in and have a seat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0774]
Evening! Did Marie invite you over? Good, good!
Do come in and make yourself at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0775]
Now then, who would like to hear about my recent
discovery concerning a plant I'm studying?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0776]
I wouldn't mind, but I'd also love to hear about
<playername>'s day and how the farm is doing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0777]
Yes, me too. I'd like to hear about <playername>'s
farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0778]
I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together with
Marie and her family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0779]
Ah, there you are! I've been waiting. Come, help me carry
the food.<wait><page>
Then, once we reach your house, we will decorate for
Starlight Night! ...Or is that perhaps a touch too much?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0780]
Good evening. Thank you for the considerate invitation.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0781]
Yeah! <playername>. Jennifer. Thanks for inviting us!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0782]
Yeah! <playername>. Jennifer. Thanks for inviting us!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0783]
Well, it is Starlight Night, after all. The more the
merrier!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0784]
I had envisioned this night surrounded by sheep,
but I guess being surrounded by people is also acceptable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0785]
You really like sheep, don'tcha, Jennifer?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0786]
Yes, that I do. I would love to spend my every waking hour
basking in their warm and gentle auras.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0787]
Guess what, guess what! My mattress is stuffed full of
sheep wool!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0788]
Really...? Do you feel the sheep's energies emanating
from it? What sort of dreams do you have when you sleep
on it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0789]
Well, um, it's warm an' fluffy an' soft an' snuggly an'...an'...
just NNNMMMMM!!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0790]
Soft, snuggly, and "nnnmmmmm"...?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0791]
They certainly seem to be having a passionate discussion
about sheep.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0792]
I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together with
Jennifer and the others.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0793]
Hey, <nickname>. Since tonight is Starlight Night,
I made dinner for us. C'mon, let's eat.<wait>

Hey, <nickname>. Tonight's Starlight Night, so I did
my best to cook somethin' just for us. C'mon, let's eat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0797]
As tonight is Starlight Night, it's only fitting we have
a feast, <nickname>.<wait><page>
Though I must caution you. As a physician, I don't
recommend overeating, tempting as it may be.<wait><page>
Well then, enough of serious matters.
Let's celebrate and eat.<wait>

sit down and eat!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0810]
It's Starlight Night tonight, right, <nickname>?
Let's all sit down and get this party started!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0811]
It's Starlight Night tonight, <nickname>,
so, um, I made a big feast for the three of us.
Why don't we sit and eat?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0812]
Hey, <nickname>. Tonight's Starlight Night and all,
so yeah. Dunno if you'd call it a feast, but I made us
dinner.<wait><page>
Let's get the whole family seated and dig in.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0813]
<nickname>, I've prepared a feast for us tonight.
However, even though it's Starlight Night, we mustn't
overdo it.<wait><page>
Of course, that doesn't mean we can't enjoy ourselves.
Come, let's get the family seated and celebrate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0814]
<nickname>, tonight we feast. Our special
Starlight Night spread awaits. Come, let us eat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0815]
Tonight is Starlight Night, yes? Then tonight...we feast!
I made lots of yummy food for the whole family. Come!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0816]
As tonight is Starlight Night, I have gone all out.
This evening we shall feast upon savory and sweet
to our hearts' content.<wait><page>
Come, let's eat before it goes cold.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0817]
Hey, <nickname>. It's Starlight Night tonight,

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0824]
Baaah. ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0825]
Hey, how about a little trip up the mountain for some
great views? It's Starlight Night, so let's go and look at
the stars.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0826]
It's called Starlight Night, so the party can't be over till
we see some stars, right?<wait><page>
Then let's go up the mountain! The weather's great,
so I'm sure the view'll be totally awesome!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0827]
Oh... I almost forgot. Um, do you want to go up the
mountain and look at the stars?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0828]
So where's the best place to see the stars?
Top of the mountain, I bet.<wait><page>
It's Starlight Night and all, so why don't we go out
and check 'em out?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0829]
Ah, I know! What say we go and view the stars?
Missing sleep isn't healthy, but it'd be a waste not
to on Starlight Night.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0830]
I hear the stars are particularly lovely this night.<wait><page>
Would you like to go with me up the mountain
to view them? I know it may be chilly, but still.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0831]
Let's go... Up mountain...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0832]
Starlight Night is for watching the stars, yes?
Then let's be off. Up the mountain!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0833]
Ah, I have just the thing to end the night. Let us go up the
mountain and savor the lovely stars.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0834]
But first...here. Starlight Night present.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0835]
Oh yes. I almost forgot. This is for you.
A Starlight Night present, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0836]
Goodness me, I almost forgot. This is for you.
I have prepared a gift.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0837]
Oh, I know! Why don't we head up the mountain?
I mean, it IS STARlight Night, after all.<wait><page>
Having dinner together was just the first part.
I wanna go out and look at the stars too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0838]
The weather is nice tonight, so I'm sure the stars will be
beautiful. What say we go up the mountain to view them?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0839]
<nickname>, you aren't sleepy, are you? Since it's
Starlight Night, I wanna go have a look at the stars
with you.<wait><page>
Are you awake enough to go up the mountain with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0840]
Guess what! Tonight's the one night all year when
the stars are the prettiest. Let's go up the mountain
and see them!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0841]
The stars will be at their loveliest tonight. Can we go up
the mountain and see them?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0842]
<playername>, let us go up the mountain and view the
beautiful stars together. I shall whisk us there in a flash!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0843]
Say, <nickname>. On a night like this, don't you feel
like looking at the stars from high up?<wait><page>
Come, let us go up the mountain. I'm sure the winter
spirits are waiting for us.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0844]
Oh, here. I got a Starlight Night present for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0845]
I got a ring!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0846]
Pan paka paaan!<wait><page>
You've collected all seven rings! Congratulations!!!<wait><page>
...What? Yes, that's it. No, there isn't any special prize.
That's really all you get. Be grateful I did my special
cheer for you. Bye!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0847]
Wooow... Coming up here sure was the right choice.
I hope we can do this together again next year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0848]
I wonder if Popuri is looking up at the stars right now.
She really loves them. I do too, really.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0849]
Whoooa... The whole sky is just sparkling with stars!
I didn't think we'd see this many.<wait><page>
I wonder how many people are doing what we're doing,
looking up at this pretty sky...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0850]
Man, first dinner, now this gorgeous scene? This has
been the best Starlight Night yet! Let's do this again
next year!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0851]
Wooow. It's...beautiful.<wait><page>
You could see a lot of stars from the town I used to
live in, but I think the view from here is the best.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0852]
I could stay up here gazing at the stars all night...but
that's probably a bad idea. We should head home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0853]
I'm really glad we came up here. The stars just make
me feel at ease, and they look so close you could
almost touch them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0854]
Looks like you enjoyed the view. I know I did.
Huh. Maybe I'll make something star-shaped
at the Forge next...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0855]
I wonder why the stars shine so brightly.
Perhaps they are trying to tell us something...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0856]
Looking up at this vast sky in all its glory inspires me to
work hard tomorrow. Every day, a better me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0857]
Brrr...! It's chillier than I thought. I hope I don't
catch a cold.<wait><page>
But...I'm glad we came up here, <nickname>.
This starry sky is exquisite. It touches the soul.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0858]
I wonder what it would take to infuse this grand and
majestic night sky into a single piece...<wait><page>
Ahhh, I can hardly wait for tomorrow! I want to delve
into my work while this feeling is still fresh in my mind.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0859]
Reached mountain... But still too far...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0860]
All the stars... Too tiny...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0861]
Yes, yes. A very nice view. So many pretty stars.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0862]
Now if only all these stars were coins... Oh, that would be
beautiful. Could they not fall down to me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0863]
The view from here is positively delicious.
What a beautiful night. I am moved. Truly moved!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0864]
Typically, I have little interest in the stars, as I can't eat
them. But this view feeds the soul. I love it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0865]
Woohoo! The view from here is AMAZING! I've seen this
so many times, but I never get tired of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0866]
Every time is somehow different, you know? It's like the
sky and the mountain are listening, breathing...<wait><page>
It's weird. We humans have a way of forgetting that
we're not the only things in the world that are alive.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0867]
Look at all the stars... You know, after Mom
and Dad...passed away...<wait><page>
Grandma would bring me up here.
She could still walk then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0868]
She said that when I come up here, I can see Mom and
Dad whenever I want to...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0869]
Boy, the sky's so full it's like all the stars are gonna fall
out. Ooh! Look! See! A shooting star! Aw, you missed it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0870]
Well darn. That's too bad... Ah, wait. I completely forgot
to make a wish! Nooooo!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0871]
I don't know the names of any stars at all, but I really
love looking up at them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0872]
I wonder... Are there people on those stars looking up at
their sky and seeing our world as just another star?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0873]
Did you know that the stars we see in the sky now
actually burned out and faded away long, long ago?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0874]
But even though they're gone, they've still left a trace of
their presence that all can see. I'm a little jealous of that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0875]
I spend most of my time above the clouds looking down
on the earth. Standing here and looking up is a refreshing
change.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0876]
I would love to stay here with you all night drinking in
this wonder, but I'm afraid my work as a Goddess knows
no end.<wait><page>
*sigh* I wish I could take some vacation days...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0877]
Brrr...! Mountaintops in winter certainly are chilly.
I find myself dearly missing the warm auras of my sheep...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0878]
But...though my body may be cold, the pure energy of the
stars warms my soul to the very core.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0879]
Today was really something special. I had a lot of fun.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0880]
Spending Starlight Night together with my family
was a real treat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0881]
The stars were so beautiful...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0882]
...*THUMP*<wait><page>
OOF! Ow, ow, ow... My goodness. Sneaking into homes
is not as easy as it looks.<wait><page>
Hm...? Oh dear. They don't have a Stocking up.<wait><page>
Gracious, now where am I to put their presents? Hmmm.<wait><page>
I had the perfect gifts for them, too. But with nowhere
to put them, I guess I'll just have to go home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0883]
...*THUMP*<wait><page>
OOF! Ow, ow, ow... My goodness. Sneaking into homes
is not as easy as it looks.<wait><page>
Ah ha. Their Stockings is hung as it should be.
Wonderful. Now which present was theirs? It's so dark
I can barely see.<wait><page>
Hmm... *rummage* *rummage* Was it this one?
*rummage* *rummage* Maybe this one?<wait><page>
...Eh. I'll just give them this one. There. Now then, off to
the next house. Ho ho ho!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0884]
Present not defined. Please report debug issue.
<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0885]
...*THUMP*<wait><page>
OOF! Ow, ow, ow... My goodness. Sneaking into homes
is not as easy as it looks.<wait><page>
Hm...? Oh my stars and garters! Their present from last
year is still in their Stocking!<wait><page>
I spent so much time picking out just the right one for
them, too... Perhaps they don't want any presents.<wait><page>
Ah well. I shall just have to go home and make use of this
sandwich blender myself, I suppose.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0886]
Okay, everyone. You have patiently waited all night for
these special soba noodles, so without further ado...dig in!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0887]
Oh dear. I wanted to be sure we had plenty of noodles,
but it looks like we wound up with extra ingredients.<wait><page>
It would be a waste to throw them away, so why don't
you take some of the leftovers home?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0888]
Uh oh. It looks like your Bag is full, <playername>.
I guess you can't take any leftovers. That's too bad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0889]
Mmm, that was delicious. I ate so much they're gonna
have to roll me home!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0890]
Mmm, that was yummy! I ate way too much, though.
I'm more noodle than human now...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0891]

They say soba noodles are good for your health.
That means I can have as much as I want! Hahaha!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0894]
I'm just here to accompany Jeff, dear. Though, getting
soba noodles for free IS a nice perk.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0895]
Mmm, I can't wait to chow down on some soba noodles!
They're a favorite of mine. ♪<wait>

[0896]
Hello, hello! Have you come to enjoy some
tasty soba noodles, <playername>?
There are plenty for all, so eat your fill!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0897]
Hey. You here for the noodles too?<wait><page>
New Year's just isn't New Year's until you've had a good,
hot bowl of soba noodles, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0898]
Oh, why hello! Have you come to enjoy some soba noodles
too? Aren't they the best?! I love how light and silky
smooth they are. They just glide right down your throat!
Soba noodles by themselves are quite tasty, but put some
tempura on top and...mmm! Absolutely scrumptious!
Goodness, I've made myself hungry. Is it time to eat yet?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0899]
The soba noodles we have on New Year's taste just
heavenly, don't they?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0900]
Yo! You come lookin' for some soba too?<wait><page>
On New Year's, you just gotta have a hot, steamin' bowl
of noodles, am I right?<wait>

You're a big help to me in a lot of ways, and I appreciate
it. Thanks a lot!<wait>

[0950]
Thanks for the Valentine's Day gift. I got this for you in
return. I hope you like it...<wait>

I got a ring.<wait>

Ta-daaah!<wait><page>
You've collected all seven rings. Congratulations!<wait><page>
Your prize is bragging rights and...not much else. Enjoy!
Bye.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0953]
<playername>, there's something I want to give you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0954]
Wow, ah...this is really nerve-racking, isn't it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0955]
Um, you're always so nice to me, so I wanted
to thank you. And, ah, since i-it is White Day and all...here.
I hope you like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0956]
Here. This is for you. You got something for me for
Valentine's Day, so I wanted to give you something back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0957]
Um, <playername>? There's something I'd like to
give you...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0958]
I hope you like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0959]
I owe you a debt of gratitude for all you do for me, and
today is White Day, after all. So, here. This is for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0960]
Here, <playername>. As you gave me a gift for
Valentine's Day, it is only fitting that I give you one
in return.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0961]
If you don't mind, there's something I would like
to give you. I hope that you like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0962]
So, uh...yeah. Here. A little thank-you for being such a cool
person. Hope you like 'em.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0963]
<playername>, since you got me a gift on Valentine's
and all, I got something for you too. Here!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0964]
Yo! I dropped by because there's a little something
I wanted to give you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0965]
Haha... Man, this is kinda embarrassin'.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0966]
Here. Thanks for everything.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0967]
You got me something for Valentine's, so here.
Hope you like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0968]
Hey. I came by because I've got somethin' for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0969]
Make what use of it that you will, I guess.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0970]
I hear there is a custom of gift-giving today. I'm not one
to sneer at culture, so here. A thank-you gift for your
kindness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0971]
Here. A little thank-you for your thoughtful gift on
Valentine's Day. It's nothing much, but I hope you'll find
it pleasing.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0974]
Well drat! Their Bag is full. Now what am I going to do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0975]
Yeah, they'll definitely notice if I stick it in their Bag.
...There! I can't wait to see their reaction.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0976]
*rummage* *rummage*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0977]
Huh? Crap. Bag's full. Nothing for it but to give up,
I guess.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0978]
I wonder how they'll react when they wake up
and notice it. Can't wait to find out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0979]
*rummage* *rummage*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0980]
Huh? Uh-oh. Their Bag's full. This won't fit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0981]
There, that should do it. I hope they like it...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0982]
Huh? Crap! Their Bag's full! I don't have a back-up plan.
Now what...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0983]
Heh. Takes talent to fall dead asleep while still wearing
a Bag.<wait><page>
There, perfect. They'll be so surprised. I wonder when
they'll wake up...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0984]
There, perfect. They'll be so surprised.
I wonder when they'll wake up...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0985]
*rummage* *rummage*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0986]
Oh, dear. It never occurred to me that their Bag
might be full. Now what to do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0987]
There. That ought to do it. They will notice soon after
they wake, I'm sure... Er, I hope.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0988]
Drat! To think their Bag would be full. What a blunder.
I guess I have no choice but to abandon this folly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0989]
Goodness this is difficult. I was not expecting them to
wear their Bag whilst sleeping.<wait><page>
Ah well. It is in, and that is what counts. I await their
expression tomorrow morning with great anticipation.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0990]
...<wait><page>
Asleep.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0991]
Bag is full. When I brought a thing for them too.
Now I can't give.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0992]
Brought a nice thing. I'll put in Bag. Look later. Okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0993]
Aha. <nickname> sleeps, yes? Good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0994]
Ah. <nickname> sleeps deeply.<wait><page>
Oh no... Their Bag is full. And I had made cookies for
them too. Ah well. I will sell them instead, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0995]
Ah. <nickname> sleeps deeply.<wait><page>
Perfect timing. I will put the cookies I made for them
for White Day into their Bag.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0996]
Oh ho, it seems <nickname> is asleep.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0997]
My, my. <nickname> is sound asleep.<wait><page>
I made them some truly delectable cookies for White
Day, but I don't want to wake them... Oh dear, and their
Bag is full, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0998]
My, my. <nickname> is sound asleep.<wait><page>
I made them some truly delectable cookies for White
Day, but I don't want to wake them... Perhaps I'll just put
them in their Bag.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0999]
Ugh, darn it! Their Bag is full. Of all the times...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1000]
And here I thought sticking these in their Bag would be
a great idea too. I guess it won't be that easy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1001]
Oh dear. Their Bag is full. Well, darn it. I guess I'll just
have to give up, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1002]
I can't wait to see their reaction when they wake up.
*giggle* Look at them, all sound asleep.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1003]
Huh? Their Bag is full? Well, cow patties! Now what
am I supposed to do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1004]
There, that should do it! They had darned well better like
it after all that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1005]
Aww, their Bag is all full. Geez, they really need to tidy
up and keep their stuff organized!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1006]
*giggle* They're gonna be so surprised when they wake
up and find my present inside. I can't wait!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1007]
Oh no... Their Bag is full. I didn't think of that. Goodness,
try to do something new and this is what happens.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1008]
Hmmm... I hope they don't get crushed. Still...I can't wait
to see how they react tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1009]
There is no space in their Bag. It seems my surprise
faces an unyielding foe.<wait><page>
A pity, but I guess that is simply the fate the stars have
decreed for today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1010]
There. My little surprise is safely tucked away in their
Bag. I can hardly wait for tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1011]
Oh my! Their Bag seems to be most full. And after all the
effort I made to bring a gift for them, too. Alas.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1012]
My goodness, falling asleep while still wearing their Bag.
How cute.<wait><page>
Now if I simply put these in there... Yes! Perfect.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1013]
Hey, do you know what tonight is? It's Moonlight Night.
So...want to look at the moon together?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1014]
Ah. Look. The moon is something really special tonight.
Do you, um...want to sit and gaze at it with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1015]
I hear the Moonlight Night festival thing is tonight.
The moon's supposed to be really cool or somethin'.
Wanna look at it together?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1016]
Oh yeah. Tonight's Moonlight Night. Wanna join me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1017]
I wonder how clear it will be tonight. Hm? Why, you ask?
Because it's Moonlight Night. Care to join me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1018]
Moonlight Night, hm? I prefer to gaze upon the moon's
beauty alone...but I guess your company would be
acceptable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1019]
I'll join you!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1020]
I'm sleepy.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1021]
Great! I know we'll have a great time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1022]
O-Okay. Let's do that, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1023]
Awesome! It's a date.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1024]
Okay. Cool.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1025]
Wonderful. I can't wait.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1026]
All right. We will gaze upon its luminous face together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1027]
Ah...okay. That's too bad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1028]
You...don't want to? Oh. I see. That's too bad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1029]
Aww, but the moon's gonna be so awesome tonight!
Ah well. If you can't, you can't.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1030]
Ah. It would be pretty late, yeah. Welp, good night, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1031]
I see. A pity, but oh well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1032]
Ah. Oh well. I shall simply enjoy the beauties of the night
in peace by myself, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1033]
Okay, time for bed...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1034]
Okay, time for bed...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1035]
<playername>, here. These are my way of saying
thanks for the present you gave me on Valentine's Day.
I hope you, um, like them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1036]
<playername>, thank you for the scrumptious
Valentine's Day cookies. Here, these are for you.
I hope you find them equally delectable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1037]
Oh, is it that late already? We should go, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1038]
Um, since you were kind enough to invite me to come over
and all...<wait><page>
I thought I could at least make us something for dinner.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1039]
Um...I hope you like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1040]
Oh, and this is for you too. A present to commemorate
tonight's Starlight Night.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1041]
Yeah... Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1042]
It won't be long now until the new year is here.
The snow will melt and spring will come again...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1043]
I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together
with Cliff.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1044]
Aah, <playername>. You came. Wonderful. Now then,
let's invite Carter, as well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1045]
I must say, I'm really enjoying this. Most years, it's just
been Carter and me getting together for a simple dinner.<wait><page>
Making it a little party like this is quite refreshing.
I'm glad we could be here together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1046]
I heartily agree. After all, none of us have other family
here in town with whom we could celebrate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1047]
Spending Starlight Night together with you like this has
been lovely.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1048]
I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together
with Doctor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1049]
Hey, <playername>! There you are.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1050]
Hey, <playername>! There you are.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1051]
Oh, there you are, sweetie! Good evening. Come on,
have a seat right here. Dinner is just about ready to
serve.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1052]
Mom and I cooked up a real feast tonight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1053]
Rick's been super excited about it aaall day!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1054]
Popuri!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1055]
Now, now, no arguing, you two. Not tonight. We wouldn't
want dinner to go cold before we even eat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1056]
True... C'mon, let's eat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1057]
Have a seat, <playername>. Let's all sit down and
enjoy our Starlight Night dinner together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1058]
Have a seat, <playername>. Let's all sit down and
enjoy our Starlight Night dinner together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1059]
I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together with
Rick and his family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1060]
Huh. This late already? Let's get going, then.
...With Grandpa too, of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1061]
<playername>. How are your tools holding up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1062]
Grandpa, do you really have to bring that up today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1063]
What are you complaining about, boy? This is important!<wait><page>
With some farm tools, one loose screw could put lives in
danger! You've got a long way to go if you can't see that!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1064]
Ugh. Can we save the lecture and just eat now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1065]
Ah. By the way, I made this for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1066]
Dunno if it's to your taste, but I hope you like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1067]
I really enjoyed spending Starlight Night together with
Gray and his grandpa.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1068]
Ah, <playername>. You've arrived at precisely the
appointed time. Wonderful. Come, help me carry the food.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1069]
There's just something 'bout sittin' down and havin'
a good meal with other folk that makes it all taste
better.<wait><page>
See, I ain't the world's biggest talker, and Brandon talks
even less than me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1070]
Not so, Gotts. I simply prefer to enjoy a leisurely meal
in peace and quiet. That's all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1071]
Uh-huh. So why'd you go and invite <playername>
over to make a noisy party of it tonight then, eh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1072]
It's perfectly acceptable to do so for festivals and
special events.<wait><page>
Setting aside my art to drift in the tides of worldly life
for a time may bring me new inspiration, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1073]
Is that so. Welp, I'll take your word for it. Can't say as
I understand art or what it's like to be an artist.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1074]
Ah well. What are fussy details on a night like this?
Let's just enjoy Starlight Night together, shall we?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1075]

Brandon and Gotts.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1153]
Ugh, darn it! Their Bag's full! There's no way this
is gonna fit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1154]
Oh geez! How did you manage to fall asleep while wearing
your Bag? Unbelievable...<wait><page>
Hmmm...aha. There. Jammed it in. Heh.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1155]
Umm...*rummage* *rummage*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1156]
Oh darn. I thought I could just put it in their Bag,
but there isn't any space. I suppose I'll just eat them
myself, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1157]
I wonder if <nickname> will be up soon.
I really hope they like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1158]
*rummage* *rummage*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1159]
Well, crap...! I didn't think their Bag would be THIS full.
Who the heck carries this much stuff?! Now what...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1160]
WAH!! Geez, that startled me. ...It's okay. They didn't
wake up. Phew.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1161]
*rummage* *rummage*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1162]
Aww, no way! There's so much stuff in their Bag that
this won't fit!<wait><page>
I bet they'd be really mad if I took stuff out to put this
in too. Well fine, then! I'll eat it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1163]
They're sound asleep. Oh, I can't wait to see their face
when they wake up and find out. Tee hee!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1164]
*rummage* *rummage* ...Phew.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1165]
Hm? Well...drat. Their Bag is full. Will I remember to give
this to them later? I'm not sure I will...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1166]
I wonder, does <nickname> remember that today
is Valentine's Day?<wait><page>
Ah well. I'll just stuff these into their Bag.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1167]
Their Bag is full. I wonder, are they simply not the tidy
sort? Ah well. I will just have to keep these for myself,
then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1168]
Astounding. They fell sound asleep without
thinking to take off their Bag. Hmm, let's see...
Will these fit?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1169]
Tum ta ta taaah! I'm hooome! ...Erm? My, my!
They're sound asleep.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1170]
Oh my! Their Bag is simply overflowing. And when
I brought a gift for them too. Hmph! Well that's just
too bad. Bye-bye. ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1171]
My goodness, falling asleep while still wearing their Bag.
How cute.<wait><page>
Now if I simply tuck these in here... Ta-dah!
There. Perfect.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1172]
Well, drat! Their Bag is full. Now what am I going to do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1173]
Hmm. They'll definitely notice if I stick it in their Bag.
...There! I can't wait to see their reaction when they
wake up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1174]
Hn? Crap. Bag's full. Nothing for it but to give up, I guess.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1175]
I wonder how they'll react when they wake up
and notice it. Can't wait to find out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1176]
Huh? Uh-oh. Their Bag's full. This won't fit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1177]
There, that should do it. I hope they like it...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1178]
Huh? Crap! Their Bag's full! I don't have a back-up plan.
Now what...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1179]
Heh. Takes talent to fall dead asleep while still wearing
a backpack.<wait><page>
There, perfect. They'll be so surprised. I wonder when
they'll wake up...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1180]
Oh dear. It never occurred to me that their Bag might
be full. Now what to do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1181]
There. That ought to do it. They will notice soon after
they wake, I'm sure. ...Er, I hope.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1182]
Drat! To think their Bag would be full. What a blunder.
I guess I have no choice but to abandon this folly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1183]
To fall asleep whilst still wearing their Bag... I guess that
is a form of devotion to one's work? How inspiring.<wait><page>
I hope it doesn't get mixed up with any of the other
things in here... All right. That should do it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1184]
Bag is full. When I brought a thing for them too.
Now I can't give.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1185]
Brought a nice thing. I'll put in Bag. Look later. Okay?<wait>

My, my. <nickname> is sound asleep.<wait><page>
I made them some truly delectable cookies for White
Day, but I don't want to wake them... Oh dear, and their
Bag is full, too.<wait>

My, my. <playername> is sound asleep.<wait><page>
I made them some truly delectable cookies for White

them in their Bag.<wait>

Ah. <playername> sleeps deeply.<wait><page>
Oh no... Their Bag is full. And I had made cookies for them
too. Ah well. I will sell them instead, then.<wait>
