"Hey, Chisato! Didja hear? Or, rather, didja see?!"

Oh! Good morning, Mariah. What's up?

"They just announced the release date for Bo-Ku-Jo!"

Bo-Ku-Jo? What's that?

"It's the official Story of Seasons trading card game,
and it's coming soon!"

A T.C.G. based on our favorite farming simulator?
That actually sounds like a lot of fun!

"Yeah, the posters they put up all over the store make it
look really cool. I want--no, NEED to collect 'em all!"

Do you wanna buy some together when they go on sale?

"Sure, I guess-- Er, what I mean is, I was totally
planning on going with you already, heh..."

I can't wait to start collecting Bo-Ku-Jo cards with my
best friend. Let's try to get the complete set!

Card Collector Chisato
Episode 2

"Hey, Chisato! Today's the day Bo-Ku-Jo goes on sale!"

You mean that new trading card game everyone's been
talking about?

"Of course! I saw--or heard, rather--that the first ten
people in line get a free Story of Seasons poster!"

Then what are we waiting for? Let's go, Mariah!

"Ya don't gotta tell me twice! C'mon, race you there!"

...Wow, the store is jam-packed today. We weren't even in
the first hundred customers to get here.

"Well, yeah. Everyone wants to be the first to get their
hands on the super-rare Strawberry Cow!"

Let's see... A single pack of 10 cards is 400G. So a box
of 15 packs would be 6000G. I'll get two boxes for now.

"And I'll take, uh...this many!"

How many boxes are you buying, Mariah? Wait...
All you've got are booster packs.

"Yep. I gotta feel the heart of the crops in each pack
before I buy it. It's superstitious, I know, but my
secret technique hasn't let me down yet!"

Really? Huh. Now that I think about it, we've never gone
shopping together before. Anyway, let's get in line so
we can check out...

So what do you wanna do now? Drop by my place
and see which cards we each got?

"Hmm. Thanks, Chisato, but I think I'll pass. How 'bout we
call it a day and report back to each other tomorrow?"

All right, sounds good. See you at school.

"Yeah, catch you later-- Wait up! On second thought,
it's already dark outside. Walk me home, will ya?"

...Phew. I didn't expect to have to take a detour to drop
Mariah off. It's good to be back in my home, sweet home.
Now then, I guess I'll get right to the unboxing.

[box opening] *pop*
[pack sliding out] *swish*
[foil being cut] *slice*

Now, what'd I get for my very first card...?

'Tool Card: Fodder'

Wow, that's kind of...underwhelming. So much for
beginner's luck, huh? Oh, well. On to the next!

...After opening all the packs, I ended up collecting 186
different cards. There are 256 total, so that leaves 70
new cards to discover.

I wonder how many Mariah has... I can't wait to find out!

"Hey, Chisato. How'd it go? The card collecting, that is.
C'mon, let's see what ya got!"

Yeah, here, Mariah. Between the two boxes I bought
yesterday, I wound up with 186 different kinds. That
means I only have 70 left to find for a full set!

"Wow, nice! I'm still at 130. Which did you get? I mean,
here, check out what I got first."

Yeah, I've got about the same, more or less.

"Oh, nice. Except I don't have Fodder yet. I don't have any
inventory items, for that matter."

Huh. Really? Lemme take a closer look at yours.

[binder pages turning] *flip*

Oh, there's a holographic card. That's gotta be rare.
And this one's sparkly, too.
 
"Those are my extras. So if you've got any duplicate
cards of your own, we should trade!"

[rummaging through backpack] *rustle* *rustle*

Okay, these are all the extras I got.

"Let's see here... Sweet! You've already got a few
Fodder cards. And Milk (S) too!"

You have a few that I don't have, either.

"Well, I don't have these seven. All right,
how many of mine do you think you'll need?"

Turns out I need seven of yours as well. So let's go ahead
and trade, shall we?

"Yeah, fine. I mean, thanks, Chisato!"

Right back at you, Mariah.

After swapping extras, my Story of Seasons trading card
collection has grown. That's 193 down, 63 to go!

Card Collector Chisato
Episode 4

Today I came to the store alone. My best friend wasn't
at school, so I couldn't invite her to come with me.

I think I'll only buy three packs this time. (If I bought
boxes all the time, I'd use up my whole allowance.)

Now, which should I get? Mariah said she tries to feel
the heart of the crops--whatever that means. I close
my eyes and concentrate...

But they still feel like normal cards to me, so I just grab
three random packs and check out.

After shopping, I head straight home. Once I'm there...

Well, I guess I'll go ahead and open them.
[packs tearing] *riiip*

Ooh, this one's holographic! So shiiiny...!

'Equipment Card: Super Sickle'

A rare one? Sweet! So after opening all the packs...
Unfortunately, the other cards were ones I already had.

Well, I'll tell Mariah about getting the Super Sickle
tomorrow at school--assuming she even shows up.
Where could she be?

My friend might be missing, but my Story of Seasons
trading card collection continues. 194 down, 62 to go!

The next day...

"Morning, Chisato! Long time no see, huh?"

Oh, Mariah. Are you feeling better?

"Yeah, I'm fine now. Did ya miss me?"

Well, you weren't at school all of a sudden, so I didn't
really know what to think.

"Sorry to make you worry!"

It's all right, I'm just glad you're okay.

Anyway, it's been a while--well, only a day, but it felt like
forever--so do you want to go buy more Bo-Ku-Jo cards
together?

"Sure. I mean, of course!"

I think I'm going to take things slow and steady today.
Three packs should be enough for me.

"Well, I've got catching up to do, so I'm gonna try
something new and buy a whole box!"

Nooow, which ones should I get? I'll take this, and this,
and this!

"Thank you, come again!"

...Ah, home at last. Guess I'll open 'em straightaway.

[pack opening] *riiip*

'Equipment Card: Tomato Seeds'

Looks like this card was the only one I didn't already
have. But hey, progress is progress!

It's an uphill battle to complete my Story of Seasons
trading card collection, but with 193 down and 61 to go,
I know I can do it!

Card Collector Chisato
Episode 6

There's no school today! I'll go buy cards on my own.

Looks like I wasn't the only one who thought of coming to
the store. I think I'll just stick to three packs again.

But the question is, which ones should I get? Heh, maybe
I'll close my eyes and ask the heart of the crops...

Nah, I feel ridiculous. I'll just grab this, and this, and this!

Lemme just grab my wallet and... Huh? That's Mariah
over there. And it looks like she's buying some Bo-Ku-Jo
cards, too.

Maybe we can trade for a few that I don't have yet?

Hey there, Mariah!

"Oh hi, Chisato. Morning. So how much you got? Er, maybe
it'd be easier if I just checked out your binder. You mind?"

Not at all! Here, take a look.

"Hmmm, you've got a lot. Like, I don't have this one. Or
this one. Oh, you have the Super Scythe too. Nice. I mean,
look at mine."

Don't sell yourself short. You've obviously got a lot, too!
Oh, like this one. I've never even seen a Kappa before!

Now that we've looked through each other's cards...

So, what do you think? I don't have any Potato Seeds,
or this Mithril Watering Can.

"I have extras of those, so I can part with 'em.
But I don't have this kind of Sheep, or this Red Grass,
or a Blue Feather."

I only have one Super Scythe, but I have extras of the
others, so do you still wanna trade those?

"Meh. I mean, yeah, sweet!"

I got a good haul today, trading off my doubles.

...Oh, but what if the packs I bought have a lot of the
cards I just traded for? Oh, well. The only way to find out
is to open them.

[pack opening] *rip* *tear*

Oh cool, another rare card!

'Character Card: Harvest Goddess'

She's so pretty. I wonder what other kinds
of characters there are.

Whew, that went well. I didn't get too many duplicates,
and came out with a decent amount of new ones!

The Story of Seasons trading card game is so much fun!
And I've only got 25 more to find for a full set.

Episode 7

I've got classroom cleanup duty today, so I told my best
friend Mariah to go to the store ahead of me.

Okay, all done. Better hurry so I can catch up!

Now, which packs should I get? I'll go with this,
and this, and this!

"Here's your change. Have a nice day!"

Thanks, you too! See you next time.

Hmm, I wonder where Mariah is? Wait, there's
something shiny on the ground over there...
It's a Story of Seasons trading card!

'Food Card: Milk (G)'

Oh my gosh. That one's super rare!

I'm trying to find its owner, but there's no one in sight.
What should I do...?

It's like there's a little angel sitting on my shoulder
saying, "The person who dropped this must be missing it,
so you should turn it in to the police."

And on my other shoulder, a tiny demon is whispering,
"Whoever dropped this card already forgot about it.
Finders keepers, losers weepers!"

But as I'm lost in thought over this ethical dilemma...

"Oh, Chisato. Great timing. Have you seen a Bo-Ku-Jo
card around here? I lost my Milk (G)."

Ah, this must be yours. Here you go.

"Oh wow, great! I knew retracing my steps would help.
I'm glad you're the one who picked it up, Chisato.
I really owe you."

No, that's okay.

"Don't say that! I mean, then I won't feel good about it.
I'll give you this card to show my thanks."

'Food Card: Tomato'

I don't have that one yet. Are you sure?

"Last time we traded, you said you were still looking for
one. And I just got a double of it, so here!"

Thanks.

Well, I got an unexpected haul today. It sure was nice
of Mariah to give me a new card for finding hers.

But man, I'm jealous of that Milk (G) card. Oh well.
Let's see what I brought home from the store.

[pack opening] *rip* *tear*

'Food Card: Milk (G)'

Wow, what are the odds of getting my own so fast? Oh,
but there's also extras of the other new card I just got.
Funny how that works, huh?

I only need to find 12 more Story of Seasons trading
cards to complete my collection. I've got this!

Episode 8

Today I'm going to the store alone. Apparently, Mariah
had an errand to run, so she couldn't come with me.

Well, here I am. I'll just grab the first three Bo-Ku-Jo
packs I see on the shelf, as per usual.

"Here's your change. Have a nice day!"

...Home at last! I can't wait to find out what I got,
so I'll run straight up to my room and get cracking.

[pack being opened] *rip* *tear* *slide*

Awww! They're all cards I have already. I haven't added
to my collection at all.

I've still got 12 left to find, but this is turning into one
hobby that does NOT get cheaper by the dozen...

But with 244 different Story of Seasons trading cards in
my collection, it's only a matter of time before I've got
the full set. I can't give up now!

"Thanks for walking to the store with me today,
Chisato!"

Anytime, Mariah. I think I'll be buying three packs again,
just like before.

"Heh! I might believe in the heart of the crops,
but I see you've got your own superstitions!"

More like, three is all I can afford on my allowance...

"Oh, that makes sense. C'mon, let's check out already."

I still have to finish that book report tonight, so I'm gonna
hurry home.

"Okay, see you at school tomorrow. Let's tell each other
what we got before class starts, yeah?"

Yeah. Bye, now!

...Okay, let's open these babies and see what I get.

[pack being opened] *rip* *tear* *swish*

Awww! They're all extras I already had. Again!
My collection hasn't grown at all! Oh, well...
Such is the life of a card collector.

In the Story of Seasons trading card game, you win some,
you lose some. Luckily, I've only got a dozen left for a

Episode 10

"Morning, Chisato. What'd you get? Or should I say,
how'd your haul turn out yesterday?"

I got nothing but doubles, unfortunately. The same thing
happened the day before yesterday, too...

"Well, you've already got most of the cards in the set.
It's only natural. I mean, at least you have more extras
to trade with now."

Huh. When you put it that way, I guess it's not so bad.
So how did you do, Mariah?

"I made out like a bandit. That is to say, I've only got five
cards to go."

Seriously? When did you get that much?

"I told you, just yesterday. As in, the packs I bought
barely had any duplicates at all."

Huh. Lucky you. Now I'm jealous.

"But I did get some extras, so let's trade. Or at least,
let's compare what we have to spare."

Sure. These're my duplicates. *thud*

"Wow, you do really do have a lot of extras. I'll happily
take a few off your hand! I'm missing this one, this one,
and this one."

And you've got a bunch of cards I don't have, too!
Like this one and this one and this one and this one
and this one and...whoa!

'Animal Card: Golden Chicken'

That's a rare one! And you managed to get double?

"Yep. So, are those eight that you don't have good?"

Yeah, but...

"Then I'll take these three I need and you can have all of
those. Let's trade."

What? You sure?

"Think of it this way: having extras of one card doesn't do
either of us any good, but together we can both get that
much closer to our goal."

Can't argue with that logic! Thanks, see you!

I guess I won't need to stop by the store today.
But tomorrow's a brand new day for card collecting,
and I only need four more to complete my set!

"Morning, Chisato. I didn't see you at the store
yesterday. Didn't you wanna buy more cards?"

No. I didn't get any new ones for three days in a row,
so I kinda felt like giving up.

"Yeah, that's gotta be a letdown."

But then when I got eight new cards at once yesterday,
I decided to quit while I was ahead and went home.

"Makes sense. Well, anyway, I don't know about you,
but I'm going back to the store today."

Then I'll go with you.

"C'mon, last one there is a Regular Egg!"

Now that we're here, I think I'll stick to my usual three
packs of cards.

"The heart of the crops tells me to take this one.
Oh, and this one too!"

You're fast! Hmm, which should I pick? I can't decide.

"How 'bout these two? I'm getting good vibes from 'em."

Yeah, okay. Might as well.

[cash register opening] *cha-ching*
"Thank you, come again!"

That was fun, but I'd better get heading home. 

"Okay, bye for today. Oh yeah, and let's tell each other
what we got at school tomorrow."

Yeah, talk to you later.

All right then, let's open these up and see what
the 'heart of the crops' brought me today, heh.

[pack being opened] *rip* *tear* *slide*

Oh, wow! I got three I didn't have before!

Only one more Bo-Ku-Jo card for a complete set.
Victory is so close, I can almost taste it!

"Morning, Chisato! I got a pretty good haul yesterday.
But enough about me. How'd you do?"

Oh, hey, Mariah. Thanks! The packs you picked out
for me yesterday had a few cards I didn't have yet.
So now I only need one card!

"Really? Is this the one you're missing, by any chance?
It's got your name all over it."

Huh? Hey, that's...

'Event Card: Marriage'

Oh my goodness! Yeah, that's the only one I don't have.
How did you know?

"The heart of the crops told me. And now it's telling me
this card wants to complete your collection."

Wait, you don't mean...

"Sure, why not? I've got some duplicates of it,
so I'll give that one to you."

Are you sure?

"I dunno, maybe not... Just kidding! It's all yours."

Sweet! Thank you so much, Mariah!

Dear Princess, Part I

Since the day I was born, I have had to live up
to the expectations of my father--and his kingdom.
I am a princess, and this is my story.

Today, as I took my morning stroll through the gardens,
I heard a commotion from the gates. Apparently the
kingdom's greatest knight had returned from a quest.

I gathered from my handmaidens that this brave knight
journeyed north to defeat the nefarious Dark Lord.
Now, having completed his mission, my father has
anointed him as the Legendary Hero.

He must be a mighty man indeed, to defeat a magician
with naught but sword and shield. I wish my betrothed
could be half so strong, but all the suitors Father has
arranged for me to meet are soft, pampered lordlings...

Why, that gives me an idea! Rather than yearning
in vain for a husband as strong as this knight,
I ought to just marry the Legendary Hero himself.

Surely saving the kingdom from the Dark Lord has
proven him worthy of my hand. I'm certain Father,
and his subjects, would give us their blessings.

But now that I think of it, I don't know the first thing
about this knight. I've never even seen his face!
What a silly goose I am, missing something so obvious.

Well, never mind that. There's going to be a feast this
evening to honor the Legendary Hero's great triumph.
I'll simply talk to him at tonight's festivities!

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0035]
Dear Princess, Part II

I, the princess, have been attending a feast in honor
of the Legendary Hero's victory. The party is lovely,
but my first impression of the champion of the realm
has been, well, less enchanting than I had hoped.

With his stiff posture and bristly whiskers, I'd say he's
more like the grizzled old soldier who trains heroes than
a 'Legendary Hero' himself. At least he looks tough.

I try striking up some small talk with him, but evidently
he's more comfortable in combat than in conversation.
Even my simplest questions turn his face beet-red
and his words to mush. It's actually kind of sweet.

I suppose marrying a mealy-mouthed meathead is better
than settling for a silver-tongued snake. Or at least,
that's what I keep telling myself, but now I'm putting
the cart before the horse. Just how tough IS he?

If I'm going to marry a man for his might, then I'll have
to see how strong he is with my own eyes. But how can
I measure whether the hero lives up to his legend...?

Suddenly, I hear an unfamiliar voice calling to me:
"Perhaps I can be of assistance, dear princess."

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0036]
Dear Princess, Part III

It is the night of the Legendary Hero's celebratory 
feast and I, the princess, have retired to my bed.
But just as I think I'm alone with my thoughts,
I hear a voice calling from right beside me.

"Who's there?" I ask, and find a young man standing just
outside the window. In my shock, it doesn't register for
a few seconds that my room is three stories up...

Why would someone scale the palace walls? Is he a spy,
or just pulling a stunt? Either way, I'm tempted to leave
him hanging, but I figure I may as well hear what he has
to say, so I open the window and let him into the room.

"Pardon the intrusion," he says in smooth, dulcet tones.
"Your question was so intriguing I couldn't help myself."

Whatever could he mean? I was just wondering how to
test the Legendary Hero's strength, but I don't recall
saying a word. I must have been thinking out loud.

"If you heard my dilemma," I reply, "then I presume
you've come to me with a satisfactory solution?"

"You wish to cast aside the shackles of arranged
marriages and find a suitably strong suitor, yes?"

"Yes," I say, as if in a trance. "That is my wish."

The stranger smiles, flashing a row of sparkling white
teeth punctuated by two long, sharp fangs, and says,
"Then your wish is my command, dear princess."

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0037]
Dear Princess, Part IV

No sooner had I thought to test the Royal Hero's
strength than I was approached by a tall, dark,
and handsome young man...with fangs.

But before I can even think to call the guards,
this mysterious stranger offers to help my deepest
desires become reality. However, there's a catch:

"Before we set about our plan to find a fiance
worthy of your hand in marriage, might I ask
to throw my hat into the ring, as well?"

Out of politeness, I try not to scoff. For all his social
shortcomings, the hero really is a mountain of muscle.
I tell the stranger as much, which seems to amuse him.

"If strength is what you desire in a groom, then I dare
say I'd prove passingly powerful. There is, of course,
one small caveat..."

Wary of where this conversation is heading, I cautiously
ask him what that caveat might be.

"I'm not human. Or, rather, I haven't been a mortal man
for a while. Not since I became the Dark Lord."

To this outlandish claim I incredulously respond,
"In case you missed the news while you were snooping,
the Dark Lord has been slain by the Legendary Hero."

"You refer to my dearly departed brother, FORMER
Dark Lord. Once your Legendary Hero conveniently
removed my eldest sibling from the line of succession,
the title of Dark Lord fell to me."

Only now do I notice that what I thought was a black
cape was actually a pair of long, leathery wings. And
curling down from behind him I spot a long, sinewy tail
that ends in a wickedly pointed spade.

A silent scream catches in the back of my throat as my
blood runs cold. There's nowhere for me to run. A new
Dark Lord is here, and I am entirely at his mercy.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0038]
Dear Princess, Part V

If I do not survive this night, let my story tell the truth
of what happened. For the handsome young gentleman
standing outside my window has revealed himself to be
none other than the dreaded Dark Lord.

Determined not to let him see how scared I've grown,
I take a deep breath and look him straight in the eye.

"Some D-Dark Lord you are," I stammer, "if pointy
teeth and some wings are all you have to show for it.
Why, I almost mistook that tail for a twig!"

If this fiend can see through my desperate attempt
at faking bravado, at least he's polite enough not
to call my bluff. Instead, he chuckles softly.

"What you see is my true form. What did you expect?
Horns, perhaps? Or a dozen arms? Hundreds of eyes?"

My mouth opens for a witty retort but all I say is,
"I don't know, I just thought you'd look, y'know...
darker and lordlier."

"Heh. It's true that my elder brother often used our
bloodline's polymorphic powers to strike fear into the
hearts of his foes," the Dark Lord says. "But you are no
enemy of mine, dear princess, nor do I have anything to
compensate for. And so you see me as I am."

"At least you don't lack for confidence," I murmur.
"But if you're tough enough not to need those tricks--"

"Illusions," the Dark Lord suddenly corrects me.
"They're not tricks, they're illusions."

I ignore him and continue, "Then how do you propose
to prove your might to me, O powerful magician?"

"It's simple, dear princess. I'm going to fight
the Legendary Hero, and I'm going to win."

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0039]
Dear Princess, Part VI

As the princess of this kingdom, I never imagined in my
wildest dreams that I'd be plotting to stage a duel
between the Legendary Hero and the Dark Lord--least
of all with my hand in marriage as the prize.

But I've decided that I shall only give my heart to the
strongest in the realm. So here I am, scheming against
my own kingdom with a shapeshifting magician.

"An upright knight like the Legendary Hero won't draw
his sword without just cause," I explain. "He won't
fight you just because you ask politely."

I glimpse a mischievous twinkle in the Dark Lord's
lavender eyes--which I only now notice are purplish--
as his tail coils itself like a rope.

"That's where you come in, dear princess," he says.
"Allow me to kidnap you."

Although I instinctively gasp, I admit that I find
his proposal interesting...even a little exciting.

"If the king believes you to be kidnapped," he explains,
"he'll order his most trusted knight to rescue you."

"I see. So you'll lure the Legendary Hero to your castle,
where the two of you will fight over me while I watch?"

"Precisely. It's a win-win situation for you, really.
If the Legendary Hero should win, there's not a soul
in the kingdom who would object to your betrothal."

"And if the Dark Lord should win?" I ask pointedly.

"Then, dear princess," he says with a smirk, "you'll get
your wish to wed the strongest in the realm, and I shall
make you my Dark Princess."

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0040]
Dear Princess, Part VII

As visions of the Legendary Hero and the Dark Lord
fighting over me dance through my head, I almost
forget that we're still in the planning phase.

"This ruse will only work if we commit to our roles,"
says the Dark Lord. "We'll pretend you're my prisoner,
but rest assured I'll treat you as an honored guest.
Once at my castle, you need only to sit in the lap
of luxury and await your royal rescuer."

That sounds kind of boring, but he does have a point.
Even if I wanted to hide on my own, where would I go?
Father's knights would find me in minutes.

"All right," I sigh. "If it's the only way to measure your
strength and his, I have no other choice. So be it, then.
I accept your terms."

It's strange, thinking of this man--or whatever he is--
I only just met as a potential husband. Then again,
I don't know any more about the Legendary Hero than
I know of the Dark Lord. So, I suppose this entire
escapade is one giant leap of faith.

At least I'll be able to spend some time getting to know
the Dark Lord better while I'm sitting around his castle.
And if this one doesn't work out, well, maybe he's got
a little brother of his own waiting to take his place, too.

A girl's gotta have options, after all.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0041]
Dear Princess, Part VIII

In a turn of events I can only describe as deliciously
twisted, I find myself agreeing to be whisked away from
my palace by the diabolical yet dashing Dark Lord.

"Let us be on our way," says my sinister suitor. "The
sooner we reach my castle, the sooner I can fight the
Legendary Hero, and the sooner I make you my bride."

"Don't get ahead of yourself," I tease. "I'm still safe
and sound in my own home. How are you going to kidnap
me while half the kingdom is partying downstairs?"

"By begging your pardon for my rudeness," he says,
then wraps his arm around me and jumps out of the
open window through which he'd entered.

For the second time this evening I'm caught so suddenly
unawares that I don't even think about screaming.
But by the time I realize what's happening, I'm already
falling through the wide, open sky.

I try to catch my breath so that I can cry out for help,
but... Wait! We're floating! Goodness, this is incredible!

The torchlights of the festivities are so far below me,
they look just like the stars above. It's like I'm drifting
through the heavens, held in the arms of a fallen angel.

Indeed, the Dark Lord has spread his wings out wide,
so black they blot out the light of the moon itself.
Supported by his firm yet gentle grasp, I finally
find my voice and let out a cry--not of fear, nor
despair, but in the exultation of flight.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0042]
Dear Princess, Part IX

Before I knew what was happening, the Dark Lord had
grabbed me and leaped out the third-story window in
one swashbuckling swoop.

If the people below hear me screaming (in excitement),
well, it'll be that much easier to trick Father into
thinking I was kidnapped.

"Does flying feel this good all the time?" I have to shout
to be heard over the wind. "That's kind of unfair!"

"You lack a pair of wings, dear princess, so you cannot
fly on your own. Calling that unfair is a tad...unfair."

"I'm kidding!" I laugh, tickled by how sensitive the
dreaded Dark Lord can be. "Really, this is incredible."

The evening breeze feels cool and refreshing on my skin,
and the bird's eye view of my homeland is breathtaking.

In a moment of childish insecurity, I begin to wonder
how far away the Dark Lord's castle is, and whether
I'm too heavy for him to carry me all that way...

But then I remind myself that all those fears Mother
instilled in me--of being too big for my bridegroom,
of weighing too much to be carried down the aisle--
are a thing of the past.

I remind myself that Mother was wrong; I'm perfect
just the way I am, and any would-be suitor who thinks
I'm too much just isn't strong enough to deserve me.

Then I remind myself while I've been soul-searching,
the Dark Lord has had me dangling from his arms,
suspended miles and miles above the earth...
and I'm deathly afraid of heights.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0043]
Dear Princess, Part X

As I'm soaring through the night sky, held aloft by the
Dark Lord, I ask him how long it will take to arrive.

"About ten minutes, as the dragon flies," he estimates.
"Would you like to go faster?"

The idea is at once so terrifying and so thrilling that the
only response I can voice is a squeak in the affirmative.

"Then hold on," he chuckles, as the black wings sprouting
from his shoulders flex inward before spreading out to
their full glory, catching the wind and boosting him
through the clouds at breakneck speed.

Before long, I spy the outline of a tower, stark
yet strikingly silhouetted against the horizon.

"You can see it now, dear princess. My home."

Wow! So that's the Dark Lord's keep. From here
it just looks like a regular old castle, though.

I thought it would be built from a cyclopean slab
of obsidian, or blanketed in a blood-red fog, 
or crawling with man-eating vines, or something!

The Dark Lord chuckles, even though I'm almost positive
that this time, I'd been keeping my thoughts to myself.

"As impressive as poison spikes and lava moats can be
while entertaining company, I still have to LIVE there
the rest of the time."

"Can't argue with that," I say with a shrug.

"Although I do live alone, so cleaning and upkeep
can be rather difficult."

That's odd, I think. Shouldn't he have servants?
If not an army of minions, then at least a skeleton
crew (literally or not) to maintain the estate.
Just what sort of Dark Lord is this man, anyway?

Whatever he's hiding, I'm going to find out.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0044]
Dear Princess, Part XI

After soaring through the sky in the arms of the Dark
Lord, we've arrived at his castle.

Swooping downward, he tucks in his wings just in time to
barrel-roll through a second-story window and land on
the floor with surprising grace.

As the Dark Lord gently lowers me to the ground,
I groan and ask, "Don't you EVER use the door?"

"Only when there's no window," he says with a smirk.

My legs are wobbling like jelly beneath me, but I manage
to stand on my own two feet and take a look around me.
The Dark Lord's castle is nearly twice the size of my
palace, yet he claims to be its sole occupant.

"It must get lonely here," I venture, "without so much
as a scullery maid to keep you company."

"Perhaps," he concedes. "But now that you're here,
these empty halls feel livelier already. In any case,
come in and make yourself at home."

This must be some sort of parlor room. A comfy-looking
sofa and a couple of dusty bookshelves are the only
furnishings, so I take a seat.

"I haven't prepared a proper room for you yet," he
adds. "I'll take care of that while you're resting."

That's fine, I tell myself, but I haven't even had supper
yet. And after all that excitement, I'm practically
famished. What should I do? Is there even any food in
this fortress? I wish I'd grabbed a few scones from the
buffet before flying across the countryside on an empty
stomach. Did I get myself into a pickle?

"Ah, so you've not eaten yet, either. In that case,
shall we dine together?"

I blink. Once again, he knew exactly what I was thinking
before I said it.

"My culinary capabilities are less than exquisite,
but I'd be delighted to have you for dinner."

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0045]
Dear Princess, Part XII

Marvelous. The Dark Lord wants to have me for dinner.
But am I on his guest list, or his ingredient list?

"By the way," the Dark Lord says, "I eat the same
things humans do. So don't worry about that."

I was worried more about getting eaten than getting
to eat, but the reassurance is welcome nonetheless.

"I'm kind of curious to see what you'll make," I tell him.
"But since I'm here, I'd be happy to make us supper this
time. What do you think?"

"Oh, but you're my honored guest, dear princess.
And besides, you--"

"I what? Oh, I get it." The blood rises in my cheeks
as I leap to my feet in righteous indignation.

"You think a princess like me can't cook, right?
Well, guess what? I know my way around a kitchen.
I've been cooped up in the castle my whole life,
so there wasn't much to do besides studying.
I used that time to make desserts and such."

The Dark Lord raises a quizzical brow and asks,
"Is that so?"

"Just so."

What I don't say is that no one's ever eaten
anything I've made before. I've jumped out 
of the frying pan, and into the fryer.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0046]
Dear Princess, Part XIII

Now that I've finally left my own palace,
I want to try cooking for myself. So here
I am, pleading my case to the Dark Lord.

"From what I've tasted myself, I'm not TOO bad."

The Dark Lord opens his mouth, but I cut him off before
he can protest.

"So please, let me cook. I want another person--well,
whatever you are--to try my food just once. Please?"

"All right, then I'll let you take care of it. I feel honored
to be the first one to try your cooking, dear princess."

"Marvelous! I'll get straight to it. I just need to make
enough for the two of us, yes?"

"Yes," he says. "May I help you with anything?"

"Could you maybe set the table? Oh, before that..."

I glance around the room.

"Where's the kitchen? And I'm curious what you have
stocked in the pantry."

"Right this way, dear princess."

The Dark Lord grabs a candle from a nearby wall
sconce and ushers me out of the room. I follow him down
a long, drafty corridor that ends in a stairwell.

Although I make an effort to keep track of my
surroundings, the labyrinthine twists and turns
of the castle disorient my sense of direction.

Deeper into the lion's den I plunge, feeling like a lost
lamb whose only way forward is through the belly of
the beast itself.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0047]
Dear Princess, Part XIV

After what feels like hours of following the Dark Lord
through the maze-like halls of his castle, we at last
arrive at the kitchen.

My host gives me a brief tour of the facilities, points
out where the various supplies are stored, and at last
leaves me to cook.

Glad to finally have a few moments to myself, I lose
myself in the fulfilling simplicity of preparing
ingredients and following a recipe.

*chop* *chop* Ding!

It's done! I call out to the Dark Lord to let him know
that dinner's ready.

"Mmm, that smells divine. And it looks exquisite."

Right? I think it turned out especially well today.
I suppose I was determined to make it work because
I knew someone (or something?) was going to try it.

"I'm pretty hungry now, so let's carry all this
over to the table and eat."

"Allow me to do the honors of transporting it."
With a snap of his fingers, all the food moves
itself to the table in an instant.

"Nice trick," I say. "It's almost like magic."

"It's an illusion, not a trick."

When the Dark Lord grins, his ivory fangs glisten
in the candlelight.

"And it IS magic."

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0048]
Dear Princess, Part XV

In the blink of an eye, the food I cooked seems to have
teleported from the Dark Lord's kitchen to his dining
room table.

"Now then," asks the Dark Lord, "Shall we dig in?"

"Yes, help yourself!"

"Then I'll start with this soup." He raises a spoon to his
mouth and takes an elegant sip.

He's eating it. And he isn't gagging! This is the first time
another person--or whatever the Dark Lord is--has
tried my cooking and lived to tell the tale.

"So, how is it? Is the miso soup I made any good?
Oh, I'm so nervous."

"It's delicious, dear princess."

"What a relief! I put my own spin on it by using a fish
for the stock, then adding in onions and bamboo shoots.
Okay, now try some of these stir-fried vegetables."

I watch his facial expressions in eager anticipation.
He actually looks like he's enjoying it!

"Yes, this is also very good."

"Yay! All right, now try some of this..."

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0049]
Dear Princess, Part XVI

Not only is the Dark Lord the first to try my cooking,
he actually enjoys it!

"Thank you for such a lovely meal," he says, dabbing
at his chin with a napkin. "The humans at your palace
are unfortunate to never have tasted such fine fare."

"Oh, I'm so glad you liked it. I wasn't sure if it actually
tasted all right. But now that you've tried some, I feel
much more confident. Why, I'm already looking forward
to cooking for you again!"

"Thank you very much. But for now, I wish to retire
for the evening, and suggest you do the same. Allow me
to take you to your room. It's right this way."

Back into the labyrinth of winding corridors and
spiraling staircases we go, but the room he eventually
ushers me into is covered in a thick layer of dust.

The place isn't filthy, but it has been neglected.
The furniture is in desperate need of dusting,
and there are cobwebs in every corner.

"I do apologize, dear princess," he says, and I notice
a hint of color creeping up to his pale cheekbones.
"I don't clean the rooms I don't use."

Dear Princess, Part XVII

The Dark Lord told me I'd be sitting in the lap of luxury,
but the room he's beckoning me into is a dusty disaster.

"I had intended to clean your quarters, but I was so
entranced by watching you cook and enjoying your food
that it completely slipped my mind."

Well, when he puts it that way, I can't stay THAT upset.

"Could you please wait a moment?" he asks. What am
I supposed to do while he's cleaning, sit and watch?

"You know what?" I sigh. "I'd prefer to clean it myself."

He raises a quizzical brow, but I cut him off before
he can protest.

"Now don't you say that I shouldn't clean because
I'm a princess. After all, I just made supper."

I'm finally outside my palace walls. For once, I just want
to be treated like a normal girl. Is that so difficult?

"Hm, yes, I understand." Surprisingly, the Dark Lord
relents. "I shall leave it to you, then. But do feel free
to call me, should you need any heavy lifting done."

"Okay," I say, rolling up my sleeves. "Let's clean!"

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0051]
Dear Princess, Part XVIII

If I'm going to live in the Dark Lord's castle,
then I'm going to clean it myself. At least,
that's what I just told the Dark Lord.

I've always had butlers and maids to tidy up after me.
Engaging in the labor I've always taken for granted
is tough at first, but it feels liberating to take
personal responsibility over my space.

"Whew!" I wipe away the sweat from my forehead
and call out to the Dark Lord, "All done!"

When the Dark Lord returns, his lavender eyes
nearly pop out of their sockets.

"My goodness, what room is this? Is it truly the same
chamber I left dirty and in disuse? You've transformed
it completely!"

"Well, I did what I could. Speaking of which, where can
I throw away the used-up rags? I've got them bundled
outside the room for now."

The Dark Lord waves a gloved hand and says, "I will
dispose of it myself. More importantly, the room might
be spic and span, but now you're positively filthy."

I look down and realize he's right. I'm as dirty as
the rags I was just asking him to throw away.

"I've drawn a bath, dear princess" the Dark Lord says,
"so please feel free to use it."

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0052]
Dear Princess, Part XIX

After cooking dinner and cleaning my own room in the
Dark Lord's castle, I am grateful to have a warm bath
waiting for me. There's just one thing stopping me:

"So where is the washroom? Oh, and I didn't bring any
changes of clothes with me."

The Dark Lord opens a side door leading into a small
chamber containing a bathtub and a wash basin.

"As for clothes," he says. "I'll fly back to your palace
while you bathe and choose some for you."

Thanking my host for his generous offer, I enter
the washroom as he spreads his wings and swoops
out of the nearest window.

Finally, I can undress and take a dip.
*splash*

Whew, this feels marvelous. It's a little smaller than
the claw-footed tub at my own palace, but it's plenty
big enough for me, and the window gives a nice view
of the surrounding countryside.

Letting my troubles melt out of my body and into the
steaming water, I idly wonder whether Mother and
Father are worried. But then I remind myself that
while the evening's events have been a whirlwind of
excitement, it hasn't been long at all since I left.

They might not have even realized I'm missing.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0053]
Dear Princess, Part XX

I was just enjoying my bath in the Dark Lord's castle
when I couldn't help but wonder whether anyone back
at the palace has noticed my absence yet.

Not that I regret my decision to come here.
It's relaxing to have some peace and quiet
for a change. And thus far, the Dark Lord
has been nothing but a perfect gentleman.

If he's half as good in a fight as he is at complimenting
my cooking, he may very well shape up to be marriage
material after all.

Well, he'll get his chance to prove himself when the
Legendary Hero arrives, so I'll take it easy for today.

I hear the Dark Lord's voice from the other side of the
bathroom door, but he makes no attempt to enter.

"I've returned with a change of clothes," he says,
"so I will leave them out here for you."

"Thank you so much," I call out. So he's back.
I'm finished bathing, anyway. *splash*

I'll clean my teeth while I use this towel to dry off.

*brusha-brusha-brush* ...Ptew!

After getting dressed, I'm all ready for bed.

"I think I'll call it a night," I say loudly enough to be
heard outside the washroom. "Good night, Dark Lord!"

"Good night, dear princess."

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0054]
Dear Princess, Part XXI

After a long day and an even longer night, there's
nowhere I'd rather be than on a bed. I'm so tired,
I fall asleep the instant my head touches a pillow.

...As the sound of birds chirping gently rouses me from
my slumber, I let out a great yawn and sit up in my bed--
only it's not my bed at all.

"Where am I? What is this place?" Only after nearly
fainting in shock and confusion do I remember that I'm
staying in the Dark Lord's castle as his honored guest.

Looking outside, I notice that the sun's already pretty
high in the sky. I must have slept in quite late, and quite
comfortably for being in a strange new place. I could
get used to living here, all things considered.

Speaking of which, I wonder what the Dark Lord is up
to now? Is he already awake? With a mischievous glint in
my eye, I decide to catch a glimpse of his quarters.

*rustle* *rustle* All dressed.

Now, let's see if I can't sneak a peek of his room.
It takes me a while to navigate the twists and turns,
but eventually I find a pair of heavy red doors that
HAS to lead to the Dark Lord's sanctum sanctorum.

I take a deep breath, lift a trembling hand, and knock.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0055]
Dear Princess, Part XXII

I muster my courage and make my presence known.

*knock* *knock*
*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*

"Oh, Dark Looord!" There's no response.
I wonder if he's still sleeping?

Hrm. I suppose I'll go ahead and make breakfast.

*chop* *chop* *slice* *stir* *mix*

Back in the kitchen, I busy myself with cooking to take
my mind off of the Dark Lord's whereabouts. He could
be anywhere...or perhaps he's just a late riser.

*tick* *tick* DING!

"Perfect! I'll go wake the Dark Lord up."

*knock* *knock*
*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*

"Oh, Dark Looord!" Still no answer.

Maybe he's already left for the day. Well, that's fine
by me! Now's my chance to sneak inside.

*click* *CREAK* "Oh, excuse me!"

Sitting in a chair just on the other side of the door
I saw the Dark Lord himself. There was no telling what
horrible things he'd do once he caught me breaking into
his inner sanctum. I'd let my curiosity get the better
of me, and now my fate was sealed.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0056]
Dear Princess, Part XXIII

Curiosity killed the cat, they say. And now that I've
walked in on the Dark Lord sitting in his room, it's going
to kill me too. I await the Dark Lord's wrath...

"Zzz," is his only response. Is that...snoring?

The puzzle pieces finally click into place as I realize he's
sleeping in a chair. Does he always rest in such a state?
Do his wings get in the way of him lying down on a bed?

Well, whatever. If he's just dozing the day away,
I'll go ahead and wake him up.

Giving his shoulder a firm shake or two, I say his name--
or title, as the case may be--and attempt to rouse him.

"If you don't wake up now," I threaten, "the breakfast
I made for you will grow cold."

His long, black lashes flutter as he opens his lavender
eyes. "Hm? Well, if it isn't my dear princess. Good
morning. What do you want so early in the day?"

"Early? It's almost noon! So, uh, I made breakfast.
Or brunch, I suppose. Do you want to eat it with me?
There's enough for two, so you can't really refuse."

"I'll gladly have some," he assures me. "But first,
allow me to get changed."

I'm about to back out of the room to give him some
privacy when, in one smooth motion, he rises to his feet
and snaps his fingers. Before my wondering eyes, the
weathered longcoat he'd been wearing since the night
before vanishes. In its place, he's now sporting the
infernal regalia of a proper Dark Lord.

"A marvelous trick!" I clap my hands together for joy.
"Why, it's almost like magic."

"Illusion," says the Dark Lord, "not a trick."
Digging his fingers into his temples, he adds,
"And it IS magic!"

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0057]
Dear Princess, Part XXIV

After all this time, the Dark Lord was just sleeping in.
So I woke him up, and now we're having brunch.

This time, I'd gotten more comfortable in the kitchen,
and I didn't even need the Dark Lord's prestidigitation
to set the table. Taking care of everything myself
instead of relying on servants made me feel proud
in a way I'd never felt back at my old palace.

"Once again it looks very delicious," my host said
graciously. And it's true! I made eggs, toast, bacon,
and even squeezed some fresh juice.

"Thank you!" It's also new, and just as nice, to be
complimented for working hard and doing a good job,
rather than being flattered for my looks or money.

"Then shall we go ahead and get started?" he asks.

"Yeah, eat up! While it's still warm!" I go straight
for the bacon, of course, because bacon.

"Then I'll try this toast first." The Dark Lord picks up
a slice of perfectly browned bread with a glob of melty
butter spread across the top.

He takes one bite of toast--*crunch*--and stops
mid-chew, as his whole body goes stock still.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0058]
Dear Princess, Part XXV

Just as we were starting to enjoy our brunch,
the Dark Lord suddenly froze in his seat.

I try to make eye contact with him but he stares out
the window, half-chewed toast still in his mouth. Wow,
was my cooking that bad? Or is he trying to watch his
carb intake? Or maybe he's gluten intolerant!

At last he swallows and says, "We must hurry.
Our guest of honor shall be here shortly."

Well, at least he doesn't hate my toast. But even if my
disappearance had been discovered by now, it's still too
early for Mother and Father to have tracked me all
the way here.

"The Legendary Hero is already at the gates," my host
says. "You see, when I returned to fetch your clothes,
I left a map in your palace bedroom leading straight
to my castle."

"With foes like you," I ask, "who needs friends?"

"My castle is only a half-day's walk from your palace,
but some paths take longer than others. By setting the
Legendary Hero on a path of my choosing, I was able to
predict when to expect his arrival."

Now it was my turn to raise my eyebrows quizzically.
"Not precisely enough to finish eating first,"
I grumble as I wolf down the rest of my meal.

"He must have come on horseback," the Dark Lord said
between mouthfuls of egg and toast.

"Then I guess we'd better hurry and eat!"

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0059]
Dear Princess, Part XXVI

The Legendary Hero has finally arrived at the castle.

"But what should I do?" I ask my host. "Does this mean
I don't have time to wash the dishes before the duel
starts? And where am I supposed to watch while you
two fight? And what about...?"

A dozen more questions stream out of my mouth so
quickly, I'm asking them before I even realize what I'm
saying. The whole reason for my running away is about
to go down, but now I'm more nervous than excited.

"Come with me," says the Dark Lord as, with a finger
snap, he sends the dirty dishes to the sink and the
leftovers to the larder. "I have prepared everything."

Well, at least someone's thought this crazy thing
through. Steadying my breath, I follow him once more
through the increasingly familiar halls. For once,
however, neither of us say a word to the other. Both his
destiny and mine are about to be determined, and
there's no telling how this is going to end. All I can do is
move forward, one step at a time, and hope.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0060]
Dear Princess, Part XXVII

I was unsure of whether to be excited or
scared about
the Dark Lord's preparations for his
duel with the
Legendary Hero, but as we enter a wide
audience
chamber with a high ceiling, my fears
are settled.

In this vast yet poshly decorated room,
with a velvet
carpet spanning its breadth and ornate
silken tapestries
hanging down the walls, I recognize
instantly that this is
where my two candidates for marriage
will do battle.

My host explains that all I need to do
is sit on the throne
at the top of the stairs and wait, so I
do as I'm told. To
my delight, it occurs to me that I'll be
able to safely
watch their entire fight from here.

The Dark Lord is standing right next to
me, so that
there's no way the Legendary Hero can
'rescue' me
without first getting through him.

It seems as if my host has thought of
everything. Though
I can't help but wonder why he's holding
a glass of the
juice I made for him at brunch. We
finished off the
bottle together this morning, so where
did it come from?

All of a sudden, my juicy ruminations
are cut short
by a slamming door. The Legendary Hero
is here!

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0061]
Dear Princess, Part XXVIII

*SLAM* The door bursts open. The Legendary Hero
enters with a valiant stride and bellows at my host.

"I've finally found you, warlock! Release the princess at
once!" He draws his sword, which looks dazzlingly bright
under the light of the hanging chandelier. I give a timid
smile and a half-wave from my throne.

"Oh, wait." The daring knight spots me and says, "There
you are, dear princess. Well, have no fear, I am here!"

The Dark Lord gives a gallant bow, careful not to let a
single drop of juice drip from his glass, and replies with
his wonted charisma.

"You've done well to make it this far, sir knight. I'm sure
you're exhausted from the trip. Try drinking this."

How noble of him, to offer a bracing drink to his guest
after a long journey. Even if he's about to fight said
guest. Or is this a ruse to poison the man who defeated
his predecessor? No, that wouldn't make any sense.
If anything, I imagine he's trying to get his foe back up
to his full fighting potential. There'd be little to
demonstrate in the way of strength if one opponent
started out exhausted, after all.

Speaking of which, the Legendary Hero was talking
pretty eloquently just now. He does seem much more
comfortable in the heat of battle than in the chill
of high society. I realize we have more in common
than I realized...

It's a pity I can't marry them both.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0062]
Dear Princess, Part XXIX

I was expecting an epic clash between warlock and
warrior, but so far all that's happened is that the
Dark Lord has offered the Legendary Hero a glass
of the berry juice I made this morning.

"I don't know what you're trying to pull," the Legendary
Hero says in a low growl, "But there's no way I'd ever
drink a single drop of anything you gave me."

"How rude!" I protest. "And after I went to all the
trouble of making it. It's all right, Dark Lord. He doesn't
have to drink it. I'll drink it instead."

"Huh?" The Legendary Hero blinks a few times.
"You prepared this liquid, dear princess? Just for me?"

The old knight's so close to taking the bait I can see him
smacking his lips, but then he remembers himself and
says, "But the Dark Lord might have tampered with it!"

"Well," I say, "I didn't make it for you specifically.
And besides, the Dark Lord isn't the kind of man--
or whatever he is--to do something so cowardly as
poisoning a drink (at least, I don't think so)."

The Legendary Hero scratches his head in confusion.
If there's one thing I can say for certain, this is NOT how
he saw his confrontation with the Dark Lord unfolding.

"I really don't care whether you drink it or not,"
I say before the knight comes up with a response.
"Because I'm going to."

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0063]
Dear Princess, Part XXX

"Wait!" cries the Legendary Hero as I lift the glass
toward my lips. He's convinced himself that the Dark
Lord poisoned the juice I made this morning.

"If you don't drink it, then I will," I say, eager to move on.

"Then I'll drink it," says the brave warrior, who takes
the glass and downs it.

*glug* *glug*

"Phew, thanks," says the knight. "That tasted great,
dear princess. My stamina's completely recovered."

He takes up his sword with renewed vigor and says,
"Now, I shall defeat the Dark Lord and return you
safely to the palace, so hang on just a little longer."

Satisfied that I finally get to watch a couple
of beefcakes wail on each other for my amusement,
I settle into my seat as the show begins.

"Begone, monster!" cries the Legendary Hero.
"You don't belong in this kingdom!"

"It was not by my request that you have come,"
says the Dark Lord. "We were called here by
the princess, who wished to offer me her hand."

"Her hand? You stole a girl from her home,
and made her your prisoner!"

"Perhaps the same could be said of all
arranged marriages."

"Princesskind ill needs a suitor such as you!"

"What is a princess?" The Dark Lord throws his glass,
which shatters on the floor. "A marriageable little
pile of secrets! But enough talk, have at you!"

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0064]
Dear Princess, Part XXXI

At long last, the final battle between the Dark Lord
and the Legendary Hero has begun.

The warrior swings his sword, but the warlock dodges.
Then the warlock fires a bolt of lightning, but the
warrior's shield deflects it. Back and forth they take
turns attacking each other; sometimes they land a hit,
sometimes they miss, rinse and repeat...

I hate to say it, but this is actually kind of boring.

The Legendary Hero's been putting up a valiant effort,
but the Dark Lord definitely has the upper hand. As the
fight drags on, I notice that the knight is already
running out of breath. The Legendary Hero is a mortal
man after all, unlike the Dark Lord, who hasn't even
broken a sweat. I think this fight's just about over.

"Abraca-TAKE THIS!" says the Dark Lord, firing
a magic missile from his fingertips that knocks
the Legendary Hero to the ground.

As he drags himself back up to his feet, the knight says,
"You're on another level from the last Dark Lord."

"To your credit," says the warlock, "I see now that your
title is well-earned. But playtime is over."

The Dark Lord raises a hand to fire off another salvo
of enchanted projectiles, and I realize that the next time
the Legendary Hero gets knocked down, he won't be
getting back up again.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0065]
Dear Princess, Part XXXII

The fight I've orchestrated is about to end in bloodshed
as the Dark Lord powers up a spell that will finish the
Legendary Hero for good.

"Enough!" I cry, as I stand up from my seat and clap my
hands together. The two combatants stop fighting
long enough to give me their attention.

"That will be all," I tell the men. "Sir knight, you may
return to the palace. I'll be staying here from now on."

The Legendary Hero scratches his bruised and bristly
chin. "But what do I tell the king and queen?"

Oh, right. I can't just send him back empty-handed.
Fortunately, a burst of inspiration strikes!
"How about this...?"

First, I'll write my last will and testament... *scribble*
Then I'll have to take off one of my shoes... *thock*
Now I'll need to borrow your sword for a moment...
And yes, I'm going to cut my hair with it. *swish*

"That should do it," I proclaim, quite pleased with myself
for the cunning plan I've hatched. "Sir knight, would you
be so kind as to take all this to my father and mother?

I try to hand over my shoe, the will I wrote, and my locks
of hair to the Legendary Hero, but he's completely lost.
It only now dawns on me that I never explained anything
to him, so of course he wouldn't understand!

"Pull up a seat," I tell the Legendary Hero.
"This is going to take a while."

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0066]
Dear Princess, Part XXXIII

"...And that's why I'm going to be staying
with the Dark Lord from now on," I finish
explaining to the Legendary Hero.

At first, the warrior is at a loss for words. But beneath
his craggy brow I see his eyes soften, and with a heavy
sigh he finally sheathes his sword.

"I may not understand what you're doing," he says.
"But if that is your wish, I must oblige."

I thank the Legendary Hero for his compassion, but he
grunts and waves off my words with a gauntleted hand.

"Don't get me wrong," says the knight. "I don't like it
any more than I understand it. But I could return with
an army and still not be able to defeat this Dark Lord,
so I don't have much other choice."

"Well, at least you know when to quit," says my new
groom-to-be. "So allow me to show my own gratitude
by healing your wounds."

With a snap of his fingers, the battered knight's cuts
and bruises all vanish in an instant.

"What an amazing trick," I say. "It's almost like magic!"

"It's an illusion, not a trick," says the Dark Lord.

"And let me tell you," adds the Legendary Hero,
"it really IS magic!"

With that, the three of us all fall into a chorus
of uproarious laughter.

To be continued...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0067]
Dear Princess, Part XXXIV

To an uninformed outsider, the sight of a princess,
a knight, and a warlock all sitting and laughing
together must have been a strange sight indeed.
But to us, we were just three newfound friends,
planning the bright futures that awaited us.

"If you go back now," the Dark Lord says, "The king
and queen will wonder what became of me. So, tell
them that you defeated me in combat."

"Are you sure?" asks the Legendary Hero. "You're
stronger than the last three Dark Lords combined,
so pretending to lose to me would be..."

"I never desired wealth, nor fame, nor power,"
says my husband-to-be. "I am content simply
with earning the love of my dear princess."

"In that case," says the knight, "I hope you two
live happily ever after."

"Thank you," I tell him. "Farewell!"

After we part ways and I watch the Legendary Hero
disappear over the edge of the horizon, it dawns
on me that no one will ever bother us again.

I retire to my bedroom, where the Dark Lord awaits.
I still have so much left to learn about him, and he
seems just as eager to discover everything there is
to know about me. We truly are meant to be.

The tale of our wedding, and the adventures that
followed, is a story for another time. For now,
I have an immortal fiance waiting for me,
and a very long engagement to enjoy...

For I have become the Dark Princess.

Mayonnaise for a cooking showdown?!

And the winner is...
Contestant B, I guess. Their preparation was identical,
so it came down to the quality of the Egg.

Hey, this was bought at the Clinic! The receipt's even still
attached. I mean, they do sell this there, so I guess it's
okay to buy it, but...

Viola pulled ahead once again, continuing her dominance
from the first race, while Lupin, on the other hand,
seemed to have trouble with her mech and couldn't use
much magic. In her stead, the twins Bellis and Cosmos
gave Viola a run for her money. They closed the gap with
their Shining Light Wings and Shadowy Dark Wings
magic, but they still couldn't quite catch up to Viola. And
then it was over! Viola claimed her second consecutive
victory!

Twins Bellis and Cosmos really turned the tables on the
field this time! Just as the race got underway they
revealed for the first time their two-cast magic, and the
combined spells, Shining Darkness Wings, shot them far
into the lead! They raced around the track fending off all
attacks and kept both first and second places for
themselves! Incredible!

Viola, who was forced to retire last time, could only claim
third, so Bellis is a mere two points away from stealing
the top of the leader board in terms of total points.
Incidentally, Liatris, who also retired last time, collided
with Amary, knocking them both out of the race.

The fifth race recap and results are in!

Drama before the race even began! Lavandula issued
Bellis an ominous warning: sit this one out! Apparently,
she predicted that the light magic-using twin would come
into contact with her this race and both would be forced
to retire. Naturally, Bellis ignored the warning and
entered the race anyway. And as fate would have it, on
the twelfth lap while Bellis and Cosmos were using their
two-cast magic, Lavandula, who was a lap behind, tried to
force her way past them, causing a collision that sent all
three out of the competition as predicted! Worry not,
though. Since they crashed while casting magic, their
spiritual health is of more concern than their physical
health.

Today we will only announce who placed first through
third. Tune in tomorrow for the full announcement.

Bellis and Lavandula, who collided last time, sat this one
out today for a bit of recovery time. Since Bellis didn't
enter, Cosmos couldn't use two-cast magic and had
a tough time of it. In the meantime, Lupin, Viola,
and the up-and-coming Miltonia all gunned for
first place. In the end, Lupin used her Mirage Body
spell to break free of the pack, claiming victory
for herself. Now she and Viola are tied for first place
in terms of total points.

that Bellis made a full recovery.

The eighth race recap and results are in!

Lupin took first in the qualifying session, and managed to
use her Mirage Body magic to good effect and secure a
lead in the race as well, maintaining pole position right up
to the finish line. With Lupin's first place finish, Viola has
finally been unseated on the leader board.

The former leader's own performance during the race,
however, was not so easy-breezy. She unveiled her long-
awaited new mech, Crassa, but wound up coming in sixth.
Perhaps her new machine needs a tune up?

And for something both predicted and yet unexpected,
Lavandula scored her first points as she foretold! Truly,
it was a race full of surprises!

Today we will only announce who placed first through
third. Tune in tomorrow for the full announcement.

Announcing the full results of the ninth race:

The day's race was cursed with unfortunate weather.
Heavy rain made it hard for fan and competitor alike to
see more than a few meters ahead.

While everyone else was taking it slow, Miltonia surged
forward, heedless of the damage inflicted on her mech.
She poured on the recovery magic in her reckless pursuit
of first place, but she may have overdone it! Though
victorious, it seems she didn't make it out unscathed, and
she may not be able to participate in the final race. And
here she had finally come out on top in terms of total
points, too! How very unfortunate.

With Miltonia stuck on the sidelines for the final, the
race for the crown was an all-out battle between the
other top three on the leader board. But one competitor
soared above the rest...

Viola's new mech, Crassa, finally showed its true colors!
Its wind form was so fast that not even Bellis and
Cosmos' two-cast magic could challenge it. And that's not
all! Its other forms were so versatile that it could handle
any kind of terrain.

And by claiming first in this race, Viola stole the overall
first place in terms of total points as well!
Congratulations, Viola!

third. Tune in tomorrow for the full announcement.

Newcomer Lycoris nabs first place in the first race of

had a great lead until the last lap when Lycoris secretly
used Space Switch to steal first! However, could Lycoris'
Space Switch be dangerous depending on where she is
when she uses it? There are some who even say that this
magic should be forbidden! I'll report the full details when
I get them. In any case, Viola finished in last place this

The second race recap and results are in!

Lycoris, whose debut race saw her quite literally jump
into the lead, is currently taking a break. It seems Space
Switch costs a fair bit of MP and cannot be used
frequently. And continuing the second season's trend of
shake-ups, Viola is apparently still upset over her earlier
loss and isn't racing in top form today.

Without the upstart newcomer and last season's
champion, the race became a close contest between the
twins Bellis and Cosmos and Lupin. Lupin used her
Mirage Body while between the twins to prevent their
two-cast magic, and claimed first place for herself.

Today we will only announce who placed first through
third. Tune in tomorrow for the full announcement.

Lycoris is sitting on the sidelines once again. Unlike last
time, however, this absence is down to mood. She just
didn't feel like it! She will participate in the next race,
though.

With Lycoris out again, it seemed like the contest for
first place would be between the twins Bellis and Cosmos
and Lupin once more, but then Miltonia zoomed up to
make it a three-way battle. Bellis and Cosmos employed
their two-cast magic to break free of the pack and shoot
to the front, followed closely by Miltonia and then Lupin.

The fourth race recap and results are in!

Lycoris is finally back after a win in the first race and a
prolonged break. However, before today's race even
began, Viola took Lycoris to task over the magic she used
in the first race. The surrounding contestants managed
to stop her, but apparently she's still quite irritated over
it, and it's clearly taken a toll on her racing form, as
evidenced by her performance later on. Viola and Lupin
collided, forcing both to retire from the race. Lycoris,
meanwhile, was able to claim first place without even
having to use Space Switch.

third. Tune in tomorrow for the full announcement.

The fifth race recap and results are in!

Once again, Lavandula foretold of a collision between
herself and Bellis, and just like before, Bellis refused to
heed her warning. Bellis stayed clear of Lavandula for
much of the race until falling a lap behind. Lavandula's
mech then suffered a sudden malfunction, causing her to
lose speed and crash into the ship behind her. As
predicted, it was Bellis'. Both were forced to exit the
race. It seems her fortunes DO always come true. And
with Bellis' departure, Lycoris' victory has moved her
back up the leader board into first place.

Drama and disaster at the races! This time Bellis took

unavoidable collision that took out all three! Forced to
retire once again, Bellis' twin sister now surpasses her in
total points as she falls to third place. With Lycoris

F-3.14MGP Season 2
The seventh race recap and results are in!

As everyone suspected, Lycoris was absent from today's
race. Lupin nabbed first place this time with the debut of
her new mech, Boreus! She blocked Bellis' and Cosmos'
magic, hamstringing their ace move to snag first place
with ease. With today's results, Lupin, Bellis, and Cosmos
are all tied for second place in total points.

Today we will only announce who placed first through
third. Tune in tomorrow for the full announcement.

The eighth race recap and results are in!

Lycoris recovered quickly, making the showdown between
her and Lupin's new mech the focus of the race. But even
Lupin's powerful upgrade couldn't counter Lycoris'
space-bending magic. In the middle of the race, Lycoris
found herself between Lavandula and Amary who were a
lap behind, and sensing danger, used Spatial Dimension to
shoot past the final corner and claim victory. There are
only two races left now. Will Lycoris manage to
dominate in total points as well?

Today we will only announce who placed first through
third. Tune in tomorrow for the full announcement.

The ninth race recap and results are in!

As was more or less expected, Lycoris claimed victory
once again. The second place finisher, Miltonia, couldn't
even come close to the points leader, clocking in at a full
fifty-two seconds behind! With this win, Lycoris is also
now light years ahead on the leader board, securing her
place as Season 2's champion without even accounting for
the final race.

However, it's not over yet! I hope all of our competitors
will do their best in the last race, leaving no regrets
behind. Though, since the overall winner has already been
decided, they may find it hard to muster much
motivation...

Switch only to have Euco dodge it and zoom to first!

Lycoris seemed to be having trouble with her mech last
time, but she was in perfect form this race. However,
during the last lap, Euco unveiled her ace in the hole,
Personal Time, and claimed first place while everyone
was stopped in their tracks.

Well, at least that's what we think happened. Euco's
magic apparently has an effect radius that includes foe,
fan, and announcer alike. In any case, she suddenly
appeared far ahead of Lycoris and crossed the finish line
with time to spare.

third. Tune in tomorrow for the full announcement.

Race three took an unexpected turn!

used last time, Euco was unable to bring out her top
speed during the race. Too tired to dodge Moraea's
Azure Dragon summon, she swerved off the course! But
she also took Moraea with her, so they've both retired
now.

Lycoris seized the advantage in the chaos and zoomed
ahead with Lupin in hot pursuit. In the end, though, Lupin
couldn't catch her, and Lycoris claimed her first win of
the season.

A heated clash between Euco and Lycoris kicked off the
fifth race! Euco zoomed around the track, Lycoris hot on
her heels but unable to catch up. Possibly fearing that
Euco might dodge her magic again she didn't use Space
Switch. Instead, Lycoris poured MP into her Spatial
Dimension move to try and close the distance between
her and Euco. Unfortunately for her, she couldn't quite
catch her opponent and finished second overall. With this
win, Euco has claimed first place in terms of total points
now.

Once again, Lavandula predicted disaster at the races.
Before the start she foretold of a collision between
herself and Cosmos that would end in an early exit for
them both, but Cosmos refused to accept her fate. And,
as expected, the prediction came true! However, before
leaving the track Cosmos gave all her remaining MP to
Bellis, hoping to help guide her to victory. What sisterly
love! Bellis used the extra MP to good advantage and
shot through the remaining laps with her Shining Light
Wings to claim first place.

F-3.14MGP Season 3
The seventh race recap and results are in!

Once again, a fierce battle raged between Euco and
Lycoris. Lycoris used Spatial Dimension at just the right
moment, thinking she could get ahead, but Euco invoked
her Foresight at the same time, allowing her to block
Lycoris' magic and retain the lead. Incidentally, Bellis
used too much MP during the last race, and Cosmos gave
Bellis too much of her MP, so both sat this one out.

Today we will only announce who placed first through
third. Tune in tomorrow for the full announcement.

Bad luck strikes the champion of season one! In the final
lap of the race, Viola smashed into a wall and was forced
to retire. Pieces of her mech, Plena, scattered about the
track, some hitting Euco who was close behind. After
that, Euco's mech started experiencing trouble, allowing
Lycoris to pass her and claim first while she ended the
race in second. However, there's still a nine point
difference between Euco and Lycoris. Will the space
magic-user be able to catch up in the next two races?

As Lupin and Miltonia duked it out for fifth place, the
race leader, Euco, tried to lap them, but got caught up in
the melee. Desperate to maintain her lead as Lycoris
closed in, she tried to use her ultimate magic Personal
Time, but while her defenses were down she was hit by
an aftershock from Lupin and Miltonia's clash. Unable to
maintain her balance she smashed into them, causing all
three to retire. The distance between first and second
place is now a single point.

The final race recap and results are in!

Today's race came down to Euco and Lycoris. Even if
Bellis was able to take first, she'd still be short in points
if either of the current top two came in second, and so
the board leaders clashed!

Euco kept up her pace until the final lap. Lycoris finally
tried to use her Space Switch, but apparently Euco was
anticipating the move and easily dodged. However,
without missing a beat, Lycoris used Space Switch again!
Unprepared for a second bout of space magic, Euco was
hit and Lycoris' plan worked perfectly, securing her the
first place finish. This is her second overall victory!
Congratulations, Lycoris!!!

third. Tune in tomorrow for the full announcement.

Huff, huff, huff...

Why are the police still chasing me?
I'm innocent, but they won't listen!

[sirens blare]
*WEE-OO!* *WEE-OO!* *WEE-OO!*

Oh no, there's a patrol car coming this way!
I gotta find someplace to hide, and fast.

Nowhere to run but into that house up ahead. Guess I'll
head in there? But I don't want the people inside to get
scared and call 9-1-1. Hrm... No time to think, I'll just
have to cross that bridge when I get to it!

*knock*
*knock* *knock*
*knock* *knock* *knock*

No one's home? Great, now what do I do...?

The door's opening, and a girl is standing

Episode 2

Last time, I was running away from the police for a
crime I didn't commit when I saw a little old house at
the end of the road. My plans to sneak in and hide out
were dashed when a girl my age answered the door.

Oh! Someone came. But now what...? Can I really ask
someone I don't know to hide me? No point in thinking
about that. I'll just have to try explaining everything.

"Uhh... Well, actually, I need to hide out for a bit.
Just for a minute until--" I lose my train of thought
when I see a policeman walking down the road.

Before I'm spotted, I move purely on instinct and hug
the girl before pushing her into the house with me,
catching the door and closing it with a SLAM!

The girl and I trip over each other, and she drops the
book she was holding. At least I'm as confused as she is,
but that doesn't make the situation any less awkward.

"Sorry!" I disentangle myself and raise my hands to try
and show that I don't mean her any harm.

"Sorry, that was an accident. Here," I say, picking up
her fallen book. She looks at me in surprise, but then
takes it out of my hand and smiles.

"Please come in," she says, inviting me inside.
"Welcome to my humble abode."

Little does she know how close a call that was...

Episode 3

Last time, I accidentally broke into a girl's house
as I was running from the police. And yet, instead
of calling for help, she invites me inside!

My first instinct is to tell this girl she's crazy for
letting a stranger into her home, but then I remember
that I'M that stranger, so I have no choice but to
take her up on her generous--if kinda crazy--offer.

"Sorry for barging in," I murmur as I stare at my feet
in embarrassment. "And thanks."

She guides me upstairs to a room on the second floor.
Judging by the decor, I assume it's her bedroom.

"I'll put on some tea," she says. "Mind waiting here?"

I nod my head as she sets her book on the desk
and leaves the room.

Hmm... I wonder why she's helping me hide? Hopefully
she's not trying to keep me occupied long enough to call
the police or something. Well, whatever. I guess I'll just
see how things pan out. It's not like I can leave now.

If she starts acting suspiciously, I'll figure out a new
plan from there. But for now, I'm not gonna question it.

Little do I know what lies in store for me...

Last time, the girl whose house I barged into took me to
her room, then left to make some tea. I just hope when
she returns, the only heat she brings is in a teapot.

No matter how I try, I can't calm down. I'm on the run,
after all. And now I'm alone in the room of a girl
I only just met. No wonder I feel nauseous...

Still, there's nothing else to do but look around.
I'm kind of curious about the book on her desk,
so I pick it up and give it a once-over.

It doesn't look any different from a normal book, but it's
still bugging me for some reason. Just as my curiosity
gets the better of me and I'm about to start reading,
I hear footsteps approaching from the hallway.

As the door slowly opens, I brace myself for anything.

Last time, the girl who let me into her room went
to make some tea, but now the door is opening up.
On the other side...

"Sorry for the wait," says my unlikely hostess.
She's back, carrying a tray with a teapot,
two teacups, some sugar, and a few snacks.

I hastily put the book in my hand back on the desk
and sit down in the chair.

"Oh, sorry for looking at your book without permission,"
I say, as the girl sets the tray down on the desk.

"I don't mind," she says, taking a seat across from me
and pouring some tea. "How much sugar would you like?"

"Oh, uh..." I'm about to answer, when all of a sudden--

*knock* *knock* "Excuse me," calls a voice from outside.
The girl rises to her feet and starts to leave the room.

"Now who could that be?" she wonders aloud.
"I sure am getting a lot of visitors today.
Please wait here, I'll be right back."

In the meantime, I take two sugar cubes and stir them
into my tea. My ears strain to hear her downstairs.

Last time, I was just about to have tea with a nice girl
when a policeman came to the front door.

*clatter* Oops... I'm so shaken up that I almost drop
the tea I'm stirring. No wait, more importantly...
Do the cops already know that I'm here? What now?

"Actually," I hear the officer say, "the local department
store was robbed by a jewel thief just yesterday."

The girl's response is too quiet for me to make out
the details, but then the policeman keeps talking.

"That's right, we're searching for the suspect in this
area. Have you seen a young man who looks like this?"

He must be showing her a photo of me, or maybe a
sketch. Which means he doesn't know that I'm here...
but if she rats me out now, my cover's blown anyway!

"No," she says. "I don't know anyone like that."

Is she really not going to mention me at all? My heart's
all the way up in my throat by now, and the suspense is
practically killing me.

"Okay. Well, if you do see anything suspicious,
please call this number."

"Yes, sir. Have a nice day."

Last time, a police officer came right up to the house
where I was hiding. But apparently, the girl living here
didn't say anything about me. I guess I'm safe for now?

*creak*

"Sorry for the wait," says the girl as she comes back
into the room. But then she looks down at my cup with
a frown. "You haven't drunk any tea? It'll get cold."

She looks a little sad. I was so distracted listening to her
speak with the cop, I completely forgot to drink my tea.

She must think I hate tea or something, because then
she says, "Would you rather have coffee instead?"


"No, no," I cut her off. "I like tea--this tea.
It's perfect, thank you." Smooth. Real smooth.

As I take a sip, my stomach starts to rumble. Come to
think of it, I've been so busy running and hiding
that I haven't had a bite to eat since yesterday.

The girl cracks a smile and says, "I'm guessing you're
hungry. It's a little early for supper, but I could eat too.
I'll go make something, so you can relax here till then."

With that, she bustles out of the room again. Every time
she comes in, she turns around and leaves immediately.
She's a pretty busy girl!

Episode 8

Last time, the girl left her room, AGAIN, to make some
supper. Actually, I guess I'm the one to blame for that.

Honestly, I'm way too hungry to feel bad about imposing
on her, so I decide to accept the kindness of strangers
and enjoy my tea while I wait.

I take a sip and... Whoa, this is GOOD. Maybe it's because
I'm so hungry, but no tea has any business tasting THIS
good. I don't know how to describe it, but I've got this
warm, fuzzy feeling inside. And it's not the tea, which
cooled down while I was listening to the conversation
downstairs. No, this is something totally different...

Well, whatever. It'll probably take her a while to make
us dinner, so I might as well make myself comfortable.
I walk up to the TV in the room and turn it on.

*click*
"Tonight, on the Evening News..."

I was thinking they'd be reporting on yesterday's
incident, but I don't see any mention of jewels.
What about the other channels?

After a few minutes of scrolling through commercials
and cartoons, I conclude that none of the other stations
are covering the robbery, either. Whatever's going on,
I'm not going to find the answers on a TV screen.

Episode 9

Last time, I turned on the TV while my gracious hostess
was making supper downstairs. (Incidentally, I couldn't
find the remote, so I'm using the buttons on the TV.)

I've been scanning the stations for any mention of the
jewel theft that the police are pinning on me. So far,
however, they've all just been ads and talk shows. Not
a word about a robbery at the local department store.

Oh well, I guess I'll go back to the news channel I started
on. As I walk back to the desk, I spot the 'Fairy and Me'
book that the girl left behind. It's still bugging me
for whatever reason, so I grab it and take a glance.

I flip through the pages, but I can't believe my eyes...
"Anyone who reads this book all the way to the end will
have one wish granted, no matter what that may be."

Hmm... Any wish for finishing this book, huh? It doesn't
even have that many pages. But if it actually is magic,
well, it sure would be nice to clear my name. Page by
page, I dive deeper and deeper into the book...

"Excuse me," a voice calls, startling me.
"Could you open the door?"

Last time, I had just started reading through an oddly
prefaced book titled 'Fairy and Me' when I heard the
girl's voice from the other side of the door.

I hurriedly shut the book and set it back on the desk
before opening the door for her. She's carrying a tray
with a large pot, a wooden rice container, a kettle,
and a paired set of cups, plates, and spoons.

She says something, but all I can focus on is the heavenly
aroma wafting from the pot. Could it be...? "Is that curry
rice?"

"Yes," says the girl, as she sets the tray on the desk
and ladles a generous portion onto a plate for me.

"I don't know if it's to your tastes, but..."
She hands me the curry rice. "Here you go!"

"Thanks," I say. "I'll dig right in."
With that, I take a bite.

Little do I know how it's going to taste...

Last time, the girl whose house I'm in hands me a plate

"This. Is. Delicious!" It's seriously incredible. I think
I could eat this forever. (I'm probably eating more than
usual due to being half-starved, but still.)

"Really? I'm glad!" The girl grins as she puts some curry
rice onto a plate for herself. "I made plenty, so eat as
much as you like."

Guess I'll take her up on the offer, then. I eat the rest
of the curry rice on my plate. After I finish it all she
smiles sweetly and asks, "Do you want seconds?"

It tastes so good, I'd love to eat more, but is it really
okay? Well, I guess she's offering, so it's gotta be fine,
right? I'll call her bluff and have another helping.

"Yeah," I finally manage to say. "I mean, yes, please."

"Here you go. Enjoy!"

"Thank you."

"You're welcome!"

With the pleasantries aside, I take the plate from her
and get right back to eating. *munch* *munch* *munch*
Yeah, this is seriously heaven on earth.

"Whew, I'm stuffed. Thanks for the meal." Man, I don't
think I could eat another bite. Even if it was delicious,
maybe I ate a little too much?

"You must've been hungry," she says, looking at the
empty pot and rice container in shock and amazement.

in her lap. "I wasn't even all that hungry, remember?"

"Seriously, though. That was amazing. You're a really
good cook." But rather than smile at the compliment,
the girl's expression suddenly clouds over.

I ask, "Was it something I said?"

"No, it's just... I've been living alone for a long time.
I have to handle all the cooking and cleaning by myself,
so of course I got good at it...even if there's no one
around to appreciate it."

Little does she know how much I do appreciate it...

Episode 14

Last time, I was finishing up my supper when the girl
who made it mentioned that she lives by herself.

"All alone, in this big house? What about your parents?"

"I used to live with my mom," she says, "but three years
ago...she passed away in an accident."

"Oh..." It feels like a bowling ball just dropped in my
stomach, right on top of all the curry. "I'm so sorry."
I can't even bring myself to ask if her father's alive.

"It's okay," she says. "It happened a long time ago.
Dad's abroad for work, but he only cares about his job,
so... Well, he didn't even come back when Mom died."

Just when I think this girl's story can't get any more
depressing, she then says, "He's never sent any letters
or called, but every month I get enough money to live
comfortably, so I assume he must still be alive."

And I thought I had problems. Little do I know,
her family makes running from the law look like
a walk in the park...

Episode 15

Last time, I learned that this girl really does live
by herself. Never mind that I'm wanted by the police;
all I can think now is, "Is she okay?"

As we get to talking and I learn more about her, I start
asking questions about her family. Like, why didn't she
go live her dad after her mom passed away? Doesn't
she have other relatives she could move in with?

The girl smiles a small, sad smile and says, "Even if
I went to live with Dad, it'd be the same. Like I said,
he only cares about his job. He always gets home late,
and sleeps the day away on the few holidays he takes.
I'd be just as alone at his place as I am now."

"But don't you get lonely?" I ask.

"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't," she admits, "but my
relatives only act nice to me because they're trying to
get at my dad's money. I'd rather live alone than with
a bunch of bloodsucking backstabbers."

If this girl's relations are that bad, her dad must be
pretty well-off. But what's the point in being wealthy
if you can't even afford to spend time with your family?
I never knew rich people could live so...poorly.

"I may be broke," I mutter under my breath,
"but at least I'm not broken." Little do
I know how that girl puts up with it...

Last time, the girl who took me in told me all about her
history, and the reason why she lives by herself. In spite
of myself, I find that I'm concerned for her safety.

"What if a stranger comes knocking at your door?"

"I suppose I let them in and feed them," she says.
As the irony sinks in, I conclude the taste of foot
in my mouth isn't half as delicious as her cooking.

"But now I'm not alone," she adds, "So I'm not lonely."

Is she...talking about me? She's saying she prefers the
company of a total stranger to her own flesh and blood?
For all she knows, I could be here to kidnap her for
ransom money, or worse. Either I'm cuter than I thought,
or she's got some real bad apples in her family tree.

"Why?" I blurt before I realize what I'm saying.
"How do you know I'm not just another backstabbing
bloodsucker who only likes you for your money?"

She gives a wry half-smile and says, "I don't.
But at least now I know you like me."

Just then, the TV that had been droning on in the
background catches my attention. There's a breaking
news report, and the boy in the 'WANTED' image
displayed on the screen looks all too familiar.

Little do I know how the girl will react...

Episode 17

Last time, this girl who lives all by herself told me she's
not lonely, now that I'm here. I mean, she's cute and all,
but I'd think that's moving a little fast--or I would, but
all I can think about now is seeing my face splashed
across the TV screen.

"For our next story," says the reporter, "A priceless
jewel was stolen from the Midtown Mall yesterday.
Thankfully, the culprit was spotted and fled the scene
before any further damage could be inflicted on people
or property."

My blood is running cold and I can hardly breathe.
Photographs of the jewel and the department store it
was taken from flash across the screen before playing
some security footage of a person dressed like me.

"But the culprit escaped and is still at large. Those
living in the area around the Midtown Mall are advised
to stay indoors and remain cautious. The suspect is
described as blah, blah, blah..."

I don't need to keep listening in to know that the
description of the culprit, from height to hair color to
the clothes on my back, could only be referring to me.

Meanwhile, the girl is staring at the TV. How will she
react? I wait with bated breath, until at last she speaks.

"So you came all the way to my house to hide?"

"Well," I start fumbling over my words, "Not this house
specifically, I just needed a place to lie low. It's not like
I picked your place on purpose, or anything like that."

Even though it was an innocent question, I still feel
unsettled by the way she asked it--like she had been
assuming that I'd specifically sought her out.

Little do I know WHY she assumed as much...

Last time, a news report accused me of being a jewel
thief. I was worried the girl would get scared and
assume I'm a criminal, but instead, she starts asking
questions. Questions that are making me sweat worse
than any police interrogation.

"Look, I didn't plan on coming here, okay? It just sorta
happened. And I promise, I didn't steal anything." (I had
no reason to think she'd believe me. If anything, it'd be
weirder if she DID, given the evidence.)

"Yeah, I don't think you'd do something like that.
I believe you."

Huh. She accepted that fast. I know it's the answer I
was hoping for, but I didn't actually expect to hear it.
The evidence on-screen was pretty condemning, so her
blind faith is kinda more confusing than comforting.
"Um... You really believe me?"

She starts to say something, but hesitates, then picks up
the book on her desk titled 'Fairy and Me' and hands it
over to me. The hairs stand on the back of my neck.
Little do I know, the answers lie within...

Last time, the girl who's helping me hide from the police
said that, despite all the evidence to the contrary, she
actually believes me when I claim to be innocent.

But now she's trying to hand me that 'Fairy and Me'
book she left on her desk. It's been giving me weird vibes
since the moment I first laid eyes upon it.

The girl says, "So you really can see the book,
after all. Right?"


What's that supposed to mean? All right, now I'm really
confused, and I'm sure the puzzled look on my face is
proof. She smiles, and opens the book to its title page.

The passage there says:

------------------------------------------------------
     Anyone who reads this book all the way
     to the end will have one wish granted,
     no matter how far-fetched or fantastic.
  But only those of pure heart can see this book.
------------------------------------------------------


The girl points to the last sentence and says, "When you
came to this house, I dropped this book in surprise.
But you picked it up for me, which meant you can see it.
If you can see it, you must be pure of heart. And if you
have a pure heart, you can't have stolen that jewel."

There's a certain logic to her train of thought,
but the idea of a magic book is totally off-rails.
Yet there's not a trace of irony or deceit in her
eyes, only a steadfast belief in what she read.

Little does the girl know, I'm now wondering if I
escaped jailtime just to land myself in a loony bin...

Last time, the girl said she believed me, not because
of any REAL reason, but because of what she read in
a book called 'Fairy and Me.' Suddenly, turning myself
in to the police seems like a good idea...

"No one with a pure heart would steal unless they had
a good reason for it," she says. Okay then, so she's
the type to accept whatever she reads without ever
questioning it. How do I put this gently...?

"But how can you trust people--and what they write--
on blind faith?" It's weird that I'd question her
convictions when they were working in my favor,
but still. I'm not trying to take this girl for a ride.

"Blind faith? No, my eyes are wide open. I'm good
at watching people, and picking up the little cues
they don't even know they're giving."

Well, that answers that. All of a sudden, I feel very
subconscious about my every movement. But as long as
she trusts me, it doesn't really matter why. Still, I can't
shake the funny feeling I got when she asked if I meant
to choose her house. I've gotta ask her about it.

"Um, earlier, you were talking like me coming here was
more than a coincidence. What'd you mean by that?"

Little do I know, her answer is about to turn my whole
world upside down...

Last time, the girl told me about her expert ability
to read other people by observing them and picking
up on various cues.

I'm glad to know the girl who's helping me believes me,
and that it's not just because of some nonsense written
in a book. But now, she's about to tell me why she
assumed I'd singled her house out specifically, when all
I'd seen was a coincidentally convenient place to hide.

"Hmm. So you really don't know who I am?" she asks.
"Then I guess I should start from the beginning.
I told you my dad's always busy with work, right?" 

"Right," I nod, as I get a sinking feeling in the pit
of my stomach. Where's she going with this?

"See, he's kind of a big deal in real estate.
As in, he owns the entire Midtown Mall."

Putting two and two together, I recollect that the
Midtown Mall is home to the department store where
the supposed 'robbery' happened. So this girl's not just
rich, she's the daughter of the man whose wares I've
been accused of stealing. Of course she'd think I came
here on purpose.

Good news is, if I get her on my side, maybe I can get
to the bottom of what really went down yesterday.

"So I thought you'd looked up my address and came here
on purpose," the girl explains. "But I guess I was wrong.
What a coincidence, huh?"

"Yeah," I murmur, "it really is." And a great opportunity,
too. I decided that I should try to take advantage of it.

Little do I know, that'd be easier said than done...

golden opportunity here, I don't have the foggiest clue
of how to use this stroke of luck to my advantage.

"Anyway," the girl says, "I'll do what I can to help you.
The missing jewelry's in your bag, right? Then let's
figure out how it got in there."

The knots in my stomach loosen up just a little at her
kind offer. "Thank you so much," I say, "But how do we
even start? I can't exactly stroll on up to the scene of
the crime and ask the clerks."

"I'll ask the manager to show me the security tapes,
and see if I can't spot anything suspicious."

"I getcha. You are the owner's daughter, after all."

"Okay, I'll go ahead and call the store. Wait here
a moment." And with that, she leaves the room.

Our informal investigation is officially underway.

Last time, the girl left the room to call the department
store so that she could ask the manager for the security
tapes from yesterday's incident. It's a long shot, but it
might be the only way to prove my innocence before I'm
caught and thrown in jail for a crime I didn't commit.

As I'm pondering over how nice it would be to not have
to be on the run anymore, the girl returns to her room.

"I called the manager," she says. "They'll deliver
the tapes here, so we just have to wait."

She then picks up that 'Fairy and Me' book
from off of the table, passes it over my way,
and asks, "Wanna read this to pass the time?"

The first couple of pages were interesting enough,
but there's a TV here and everything, so it's not
like it's the only thing to do around here.

"Any reason why this book, specifically?" I venture.

"You've been stealing glances at it all day," she says.

Last time, the girl arranged for the manager of the

house. It seems like I don't have anything better to do
than to read 'Fairy and Me' until then.

Nodding, I take the book and prepare to start reading,
but...the girl is still staring at me.

"Um, what's up?" I ask timidly, barely managing to meet
her unflinching gaze.

"Don't mind me," she says, casual as can be.
"Just keep reading."

Except that I can't help but mind when she's gawking at
me like that. But she doesn't seem to care, she's grinning
from ear to ear. I guess I'll just have to deal with it.

At first, it's hard to focus while feeling so self-
conscious, but soon I get so engrossed in the book
that I eventually forget she's even there.

"May I ask something?"

Jumping from my seat in surprise, I blink and look
around. The girl's sitting the exact same way as when
I started, but it's dark outside and the stars are
twinkling in the sky. How much time has passed?

Was she there watching me the whole time? That's
kinda embarrassing. Little do I know, I have nothing

Last time, I was reading 'Fairy and Me' while the girl
sat and watched. But before I know it, the sun has set
and neither of us have budged from our spots. Now,
she wants to ask me a question, so I clear my throat
and stretch out the kinks in my neck.

"Yeah, sure," I say. "What did you wanna ask?"

"Would you like to watch the security tapes?"

"Oh, they're here already?" I hadn't noticed anyone
arriving from the department store, least of all to drop
stuff off. "You should've said something earlier."

The look she gives me, and toward the book, suggests
that I was so absorbed in 'Fairy and Me' that I wouldn't
have gotten up from reading if she'd tried. Oh, well.

I say, "Of course I want to watch the footage.
Where do we even begin?"

"They gave us the tapes for the whole day," she says,
"so there's no point watching the ones that don't have
you in a starring role."

"Good point," I say. "Lemme fill you in
on what I remember from yesterday."

"Excellent idea. What time did you get to the mall?"

"About two o' clock in the afternoon. After entering
through the main entrance, I went straight upstairs
to the department store on the fourth floor."

"That'll narrow things down," she says. "What then?"

"Then, I randomly browsed around the jewelry counter
for a bit, bought a brooch, and then went to leave."

The girl just nods, prompting me to continue my story.

"But there was this weird noise (a security alarm,
I think?) and then a nearby clerk tried to stop me."

"Okay," says the girl. "So let's look at the tapes
from around that time."

Little do I know whether we'll find anything useful
in the tapes. But right now, they're my only hope...

Last time, the security tapes arrived from the Midtown
Mall while I was reading 'Fairy and Me.' After sharing
my recollection of events, the girl suggests we start
watching the segments that are pertinent to me.

Then, to my surprise, she stands up. Huh? Oh, right.
The TV in this room doesn't have a VHS player
(assuming the security footage is on a video cassette
in the first place). That's why she didn't bring the stuff
up here.

I rise from my seat and follow her downstairs, where
a cardboard box has been left by the front door.

"This should be everything the department store's
camera picked up yesterday. Let's just grab the ones
that are at and around the time you remember being at
the mall. Bringing them all would only wear us out."

With that, she opens the box, and together we gather
the tapes that cover yesterday afternoon from about
1:30 PM to 3:00 PM. After confirming the correct
dates and times, the girl asks me to carry it all
to a room farther down the hall.

"This the place?" I ask, lowering the heavy stack
of tapes tentatively toward the floor.

"Yes," she says. "Now let's get started."

Last time, we decided to go ahead and watch the feed
from the department store's security camera. We then
settle down in a room I hadn't been into previously
and start reviewing the footage, tape by tape.

In the tapes, yesterday's events go down pretty much
how I remember them, from entering the mall to
walking upstairs to browsing around the jewelry
counter. There's nothing suspicious until I try to leave
the store, the alarm sounds, and the clerk frisks me.

Of course, the footage proves I didn't do anything
wrong, so that's good. But it's still frustrating not to see
any evidence of how the stolen jewelry wound up in my
bag in the first place. There's just...nothing.

I look at the girl and she's tapping her head while she's
watching, as if she's deep in thought.

"What's wrong?" I ask. "Did something stand out?"

"Yeah," she says. "Up until this point, it doesn't look
like anyone got close enough to slip the stolen jewelry
into your bag. You obviously don't look like you stole it,
but the security alarm went off anyway. It's strange.
Something else must be..."

The girl trails off mid-sentence as her eyes light up
in realization. She rewinds to when the employee tried
to stop me, then stops as if she's having an epiphany.

Little do I know, her eye for detail has the potential
to crack this case wide open...

Last time, we were reviewing the security tapes from
the day of the supposed robbery when something caught
the girl's eye. She squints at the screen and gasps.

"What is it?" I ask, getting excited that we might finally
have a lead. "Did you figure something out?"

"Wait a moment," she says, as she rewinds the video
and rewatches the part where the alarm goes off.

"So that's what happened," she says. The suspense
is about to kill me when she rewinds one more time
and says, "Okay. Watch this part."

The girl pauses the tape to point at the clerk,
who's standing near the entrance to the store
around the same time that I'm trying to leave.

She plays the segment through, stops, and rewinds it
again. Straining my eyes to catch whatever she sees,
that's when I finally spot it.

Just as I'm heading out of the store, the clerk standing
by the entrance moves their hand. At first it looked like
they were trying to search my bag, but now I notice
their hand reaching through the doorway and outside
the store itself.

The truth dawns on me. "They're holding something...
So I didn't set off the alarm, it was the employee?"

"Bingo," confirms the girl. "I think this clerk is holding
a piece of jewelry, sets off the alarm as you're leaving,
then slips it in your bag while pretending to search you."

She rewinds it one last time and we watch it together.
"See? Right here!"

She jams a finger at the screen. Sure enough, I see
the clerk slip whatever they were holding into my bag.

when the girl noticed that it was the department store
employee, not me, who set off the alarm. And not only
that, the footage shows him slipping something into my
bag as I leave. My innocence has been proven!

"So now we know who did it," the girl concludes.

"But now the real question is, why?"

"I don't know. But it's getting late. Let's leave that
riddle to unravel tomorrow."

Only now do I check the clock and realize it's already
midnight. The mall is obviously closed by now, so it's too
late to track down the clerk. And even if I were to go
out in public, I'd be arrested before I even had a chance
to ask him anything. Besides, the girl already has plans.

"Okay, I'd say it's time to get cleaned up and head
to bed. Wait here, I'll have the bath ready in a few."

Before I can respond, she leaves the room. Again.

Hrm... It's true that I haven't had a chance to bathe,
what with all the running I've been doing since
yesterday. It sure would be nice to get cleaned off.
Well, whatever. No point overthinking things now.

Eventually I decide that while I'm waiting, I might as
well read a bit more of that 'Fairy and Me' book I snuck
down here with me. I've been itching to continue.

so you can go in first."

"Okay, thanks." Then I stand up, thoroughly confused.
"Wait, I actually have no idea where you are."

It sounds like she's in an adjacent room--probably the
bathroom--but I don't know this house's layout at all.

"Oh yeah, hold on a second." Soon enough, she reappears
in the room. "Sorry for the wait, it's right this way."

I put down the book I'd been reading and follow her
out of the room and down the hall.

"Here it is," she says. "I'll throw your clothes
in the wash, so just leave them in this basket."

I open my mouth to thank her but she cuts me off.

"Oh, I forgot to get you a change of clothes. I'll grab
some right away, so go ahead and start your bath.
Call me if you need anything else."

Last time, the girl prepared a bath for me, and after
days of running from the law, I am all too grateful
to be taking one.

Once I'm positive that my hostess has left to find me
something clean to wear, I take my old clothes off
and leave them in the hamper to be washed.

Then, once I've rinsed off the outer layer of dirt
and sweat from my body, I gingerly lower myself
into the steaming tub with a contented sigh.

*splash*

Whew, this feels like heaven. As I'm letting the stress
melt out of my body and into the warm bathwater,
I close my eyes and reflect on the series of unlikely
events that brought me here tonight.

First, the police started chasing me when a jewelry
store clerk falsely accused me of shoplifting. While
I was running away, I stumbled across a house and took
shelter inside. But I had no idea the only person living
here was, in fact, the daughter of the man who owns the
entire Midtown Mall. And yet it's thanks to her, and her
sleuthing abilities, that I'll be able to clear my name.

Just as the water starts to cool, I hear a voice
from the other side of the door.

"Um, I'm leaving a change of clothes for you here. But...
they're my dad's, so they're probably a little big on you."

"That's fine, thanks!"

Last time, I was finishing up my bath and reflecting
on, well, everything that had happened since yesterday.
But now the girl's back with clean clothes, so I climb
out of the tub and wrap a towel around my waist.

The clothes she left just outside the door do look
(and probably are) several sizes too large for me.
Still, there's no point in sweating the small stuff.
Even if I did have a problem with it, my own clothes
are in the wash right now (judging by the whirring
of the laundry machine), so I can either wear this
circus tent or my birthday suit...and I don't think
my gracious hostess would appreciate the latter.

Once I'm all dried and dressed, I decide to let the girl
know that I'm done and the bathroom's all hers now.
But where is she? I guess I'll try going to the parlor
where we were watching the security tapes earlier.
Just as I'm thinking that, the girl comes out of that room.

When I enter, she holds back the laughter I assume
is bubbling at the sight of my oversized outfit.

"Oh, you're done already? I guess Dad's PJs are more
than just 'a little big.' But that's all I've got,
so I hope it's okay. Just for tonight?"

"I figured the owner of the Midtown Mall would have
big shoes to fill," I say jokingly, "but it's his PJs
I should've been worried about!"

To my surprise, she actually giggles at my joke!
At least now she's laughing with me, not at me. 

"Oh, and I got a bed ready for you here, so you can sleep
in this room." It's even got a mint on the pillow!

"Wow! You've really thought of everything. Thank you

Episode 33

Last time, I was getting ready for bed after taking a
relaxing bath when my hostess and friend returns with
her dad's pajamas, which are definitely a few sizes too
big for me. But that's okay, because she's already set
me up a bed in the room where we watched the tapes.

"I couldn't let you sleep on the floor," the girl explains.
"All right, I'm going to go ahead and take my own bath."

After she's gone into the bathroom, I decide that maybe
I'll keep reading the 'Fairy and Me' book I've been
picking up here and there. Just as I'm reaching toward
it, the girl opens the door and comes back into the room.

"By the way..."

"Yes? What is it?"

"No peeking."

...Well, that's one way to give me half a heart attack.
I thought she trusted me? She doesn't believe I'd steal
from a department store, but would happily sneak a
peek at a girl while she's taking a bath? No way, no how!
She looks at how red my face is turning and grins.

"Just kidding. Someone with a pure heart wouldn't do
that. Okay, I'm actually going to take a bath now."

Letting out a huge sigh of relief, I sink back down onto
the bed. Hrm... Was she merely teasing me? Or did she
actually want to warn me, just in case? Well, it doesn't
really matter. I'll get back to reading 'Fairy and Me.'

Little do I know, I'm getting close to the end...

Episode 34

Last time, I was about to start reading more of that
book when the girl popped her head back in to warn me
not to peek while she was taking a bath. Well, of course
I wouldn't! Not without her permission, anyway...

Ahem! Let's just get back to 'Fairy and Me' now.
I've only got a few pages left...

*fwmp*
I finished it! Finally...

"Um, are you all done reading it?"

Whoa! Suddenly I hear the girl. Wait, when did she get
done with her bath? Oh, but it probably took me a long
time to finish the book, so I guess that makes sense.

"S-Sorry," she says, blushing just a little bit. "I didn't
mean to surprise you. So, um, did you finish reading it?"

As I nod, she asks me, "How was it? Did you like it?"
I nod again.

"Cool! So, then...what did you wish for?"

"Uh, if I tell you what it is, does that mean
the wish won't come true?"

Little do I know, that's not how it works...

Episode 35

Last time, I had just finished reading a book titled 'Fairy
and Me' while my friend took a bath in the other room.
By the time she came back, I had already wrapped up.

Now, she wants to know what my wish is. Of course I'll
play along with the idea, even though it's obvious that
books can't grant wishes. But even if they could,
does telling someone your wish make it not come true?

"That's not how it works, silly!"

"Oh. In that case, I wished for my name to be cleared!"

"Great," she says. "I'm sure it'll come true tomorrow."

I nod once more. Whether my innocence is proven by
a security video or by a magical book, I'll be a free man
either way. But she seems kind of lonely, somehow.
I'm not sure why, but I decide to change the subject.

"By the way," I say, "you read the whole book too, right?
Did you wish for something when you got to the end?"

"I did. But before I tell you, um...may I ask you
a question?" She seems really serious. Well, as
long as I can answer, I don't mind her asking.

"Of course. What is it?"

"The jewelry you bought at the store yesterday..."
she gulps, but musters up her courage to look me
straight in the eye. "Was it a gift for a girl?"

Come to think of it, I never told her why I was shopping
at the mall in the first place. Little does she know,
my answer is about to blow her mind...

Episode 36

Last time, I was explaining to my new friend that when
I finished reading 'Fairy and Me' from cover to cover,
I wished for my innocence to be proven to everyone.

But for some reason, hearing my wish makes her sad.
Now she's asking why I was going jewelry shopping
in the first place, and whether I had been getting
a present for a girl.

"Yeah, it was for a girl," I confirm. My friend
looks like she's about to sink into the floor
until I add, "For my little sister, that is!"

If looks could kill, well, I would have died and went to
heaven. I'm a little slow on the uptake, but now I realize
she meant a GIRL girl. My motor-mouth starts running,
desperate to lay down what damage control I can.

"See, my little sister's birthday is coming up. Every year
she has a ginormous meltdown if I don't buy her
something. And even when I do, she'll still throw
a massive tantrum if she doesn't like what I got her."

The little frown on my friend's face turns completely
upside-down. She still looks unsure about something,
but her mood has definitely brightened from when she
thought I was buying jewelry for someone I liked.

(And no, as much as I love my little sister,
I wouldn't go so far as to say I 'like' her).

"So this year," I continue explaining, "I brought her
to the mall ahead of time to ask her what she wants.
That way, I wouldn't have to worry about choosing.
And the rest, I guess, is history."

Because of my bratty little sister, I ended up getting
caught up in this horrible incident. But at least I made
a friend out of it. And yet the girl seems...stressed?

"Then it isn't a gift for someone you're dating?"

"Nope," I say definitively. "I'm not dating anyone."
I'm not usually good at reading people like she is,
but I could swear she looks relieved to hear that.

"So, anyway..." I scratch the back of my head.
"What DID you wish for?"

"My wish...was to have a boyfriend with a pure heart."

The final piece of the puzzle locks into place as the real
case is cracked wide open. The scales fall from my eyes,
and for the first time I see the girl sitting across from
me not as a generous hostess, nor even as a newfound
friend, but as someone who means a whole lot more.

"And I'm the pure-hearted guy who just happened to
knock on your door after you wished for one, huh?
Then I guess there's nothing else to say. If you'd
like me to be your boyfriend, my answer is..."

Little does she know, I'm about to say yes.

Epilogue

Last time, you were told the story of how a boy and girl
were brought together by a book called 'Fairy and Me.'
But there was more than magic in the air that fateful
day; there was a mystery afoot. 

Together, the boy and the girl (now boyfriend and
girlfriend) had cracked the case and discovered that
it had been the clerk at the jewelry store behind
the boy's brush with the law the entire time.

As it turns out, the boy's little sister had been in the
jewelry store earlier that day. As she picked out the
brooch she wanted her big brother to buy her for her
birthday, the clerk who helped her select it fell head-
over-heels in love with the sister at first sight.

So when the boy rolled in a few minutes later and asked
specifically for that same brooch, the clerk assumed
that he was her boyfriend. And frankly, they got
jealous--NASTY jealous.

When the boy tried to leave the store with the present
he'd just purchased, the clerk ended up staging a fake
robbery and framed him. You can imagine the clerk's
surprise and embarrassment when they learned that
the boy they got jealous of was the girl's brother.

Lucky for the clerk, the boy accepted their apology and
chose not to press charges. After all, it's hard to stay
mad when you're happily dating the love of your life.

And that's what the boy and the girl whose father
owned the mall had found in each other:
partners in crime till the end of time.

As for 'Fairy and Me'? Well, one day the boyfriend and
girlfriend were out picking gifts for each other at the
Midtown Mall. When they came back to the girlfriend's
house, the book had mysteriously vanished.

There was nothing else missing, and no signs
of a break-in. The book that had brought them
together in a single night was just...gone.

Who will stumble across 'Fairy and Me' next?
Little do you know, it could even be you...

Episode 1

...There, all finished! This book I found the other day says
that anyone who reads it all the way to the end will get
one wish granted. Well, I just got through the last page,
so, uh...is a genie supposed to appear, or something?

Oh well, it's not like it's even real. But could you imagine
if it was? I'd wish to have a boyfriend. Not just any guy,
of course, but someone with a pure heart. Yeah, someone
who can see this book. Assuming the whole 'invisible to
the impure' bit isn't ALSO a load of hogwash, heh.

That sure would be nice. But if any wish could be
granted just by reading a book, well, there wouldn't be
any problems in this world. And yet here we are.

[sirens blare]
*WEE-OO!* *WEE-OO!* *WEE-OO!*

Yikes! Huh? That sounds like a police car. Did something
happen nearby? Well, it's none of my business. I'll just
head downstairs and put on a pot of tea...

*knock knock*
*knock knock knock*

Now who could that be at the door? They sound like
they're in a hurry, so I rush downstairs and open
the front door.

*click* "Yes?" I ask. "Who is it?"

Episode 2

Last time, I'd finally finished reading 'Fairy and Me'
and made a wish. I was just heading downstairs to make
some tea when a stranger came knocking at my door.

Hmm. The boy is around my age, and he looks vaguely
familiar, but I'm confident I've never met him before.
And I don't see him holding a clipboard, so I doubt it's
a solicitor. What could he want?

"Uhh... Well, actually, I need to hide out for a bit.
Just for a minute until--" the boy cuts himself off
and jerks his head back toward the road. He faces
me again, but looks as if he's just seen a ghost.

Before I even realize what's happening, the young man
awkwardly falls on top of me, arms flailing, as the
two of us tumble inside. The door somehow swings shut
behind us, and in my surprise I drop 'Fairy and Me.'

For a moment I panic--I'm alone with a stranger
in my house, after all--but it quickly becomes
clear that this boy won't try to kidnap me--
he really just is that painfully awkward.

"Sorry!" he says. "Sorry, I didn't mean to shock you."
To my utter amazement, he reaches down to pick up the
book I dropped. Which means he's pure of heart...NOT!

Ha ha, as if. He looks like just another normal boy to me,
and even if there WAS a book that could only be seen
by 'pure-hearted' people, what are the odds this random
dude and I would BOTH qualify as such? Gimme a break.

But even if he's not a pure-hearted person, he at least
doesn't seem like a BAD person. So I guess I can let him
hide out here a bit. What's the worst that can happen?

"Please, come in," I say, inviting him into my house.

Little do I know, whatever he's hiding from is coming...

Episode 3

Last time, the boy who'd suddenly come knocking on my
door had pushed his way into my house. But he seems to
be able to see the book I'd just finished reading.

So, what do I do? I let him in, of course. Usually I have
a hard time talking with boys, let alone one I've never
met before, but I find myself speaking to him with
ease. Perhaps it's the magic of 'Fairy and Me'...NOT!

Ha ha, as if! I just can't ignore someone in trouble.
But why did this guy come to my house? Does he need
money or something? If he knows where I live, then
he must know that there's a lot of money here.

He wouldn't be the first person who's tried to break in
and rob the place. If that's his deal, then I'll just have
to beat him up if he tries to pull any funny business.

"Sorry for barging in," the boy finally stammers.
"And thanks."

Okay, so he's not here to kidnap me or anything. Still,
I don't want him messing up the house, so I take him up
to my room on the second floor.

"I'll put on some tea," I say. "Mind waiting here?"

My plan is to leave him alone for a few minutes,
to wait and see if he does anything suspicious.

Little do I know what lies in store for me...

Episode 4

Last time, I'd invited the strange young man who
showed up at my doorstep into my room. Heading
downstairs, I get started on making the tea. I'd already
been planning on a pot before he showed up, anyway.

I've got enough teabags for two servings, right? Yep,
there it is. I'll just *click* turn up the heat and get some
water boiling. Uh, wait a minute. Do I have enough clean
mugs? It's rare that I have any guests over, so I guess
I never really checked. For all I know, I may only have
enough dishware for myself... Oh good, I've got plenty.

Then I'll just need sugar and maybe some kind of snack.
*rustle* Oh, this will work perfectly. While I'm getting
the food ready, the kettle starts whistling, so I turn off
the stove. *click* I pour the hot water in the teapot and
close the lid. Hmmm, is that about it? I'll carry this up.

I climb the stairs, holding the tray with everything on it
in one hand, and use my free hand to open the door.

Honestly, I'm nervous about what I'm going to find
after leaving my unexpected guest to his own devices.
Expecting to find the room ransacked and the boy
fleeing out the window, I brace for almost anything
and slowly open the door. *creeeaaak*

Little do I know, my destiny is on the other side...

Episode 5

Last time, I put together a tray of snacks and tea for
my unexpected guest. Now that I'm back upstairs, I'm
worried he'll have revealed his true colors as a thief.

"Sorry for the wait," I say as I enter.

Was he reading 'Fairy and Me'? Hmmm. I scan the room,
but it doesn't look like he's touched anything else.
So did he NOT come here to rob me? Or did he just
assume there's nothing in my room worth stealing?
It's hard to say at this point.

In any case, the boy realizes he's holding 'Fairy and Me'
and quickly puts the book back on the desk, then sits.

"Oh, sorry for looking at your book without permission,"
he apologizes to me, but that doesn't really matter.
I wouldn't have left it out in the open if a part of me
hadn't wanted to see if he'd read it. Then again, maybe
he's just saying that to make me drop my guard.

As I set the tray down on the desk, I tell him I don't
mind. Then I sit across from him and pour some tea.

"How much sugar would you like?" I ask, but the boy
fumbles over his words. Before he manages to get out
a straight answer, I hear someone knocking on the door
and a muffled voice calling out, "Excuse me!"

I stand up and say, "Now who could that be? I sure am
getting a lot of visitors today." Okay, maybe it's just two
visitors so far, but that's a whole lot more than zero.

"Please wait here," I tell my first guest. "I'll be right
back." This whole situation is making me nervous. The
boy could use this chance to do something while I'm not
watching. Or is the person at his door a friend, maybe
even an accomplice in whatever he's trying to pull?

Either way, I don't want to leave the boy alone in my
room for too long, so I determine to make this quick.

"Hello," I ask while opening the front door. "Who is it?"
The man on the other side is older, and he's dressed
toe to tip in the uniform of a law enforcer.

"The police," says the officer. Little do I know what's
going to happen next...

Episode 6

Last time, I was just about to enjoy some tea with an
unexpected guest when a second visitor came calling at
my door. I walk downstairs and open the door.

This time, however, it's a policeman. At least it's not
the boy's partner in crime, but considering the timing,
this does NOT paint the boy in a positive light.

"Is there a problem, officer?" I ask quietly, wondering
whether the boy upstairs is listening in.

"Actually," the policeman explains, "the local
department store was robbed by a jewel thief
just yesterday." At the Midtown Mall? No way!

"Oh, that's terrible," I gasp, and considering my ties
to the Midtown Mall, I have good reason to be upset.
But mostly, I'm relieved to hear the robbery ALREADY
happened, and isn't going on in my own room as we
speak. "And they're still at large?"

"That's right, we're searching for the suspect in this
area." We're pretty close to the scene of the crime,
so that makes sense. I hope it's a coincidence...

But then the officer pulls out a piece of paper with a
composite sketch drawn on it and asks, "Have you seen a
young man who looks like this?"

The sketch he shows me gets a few minor details wrong,
but it's still exceedingly obvious that the image is
supposed to depict the same person I left in my room.

That explains why he wanted to hide here. But of all
the places to grow scarce, why'd the boy choose THIS
house in particular? The plot thickens...

"No, I don't know anyone like that." The lie tumbles out
of my mouth before I even realize I'm lying. My brain
is screaming at me to send the officer upstairs so he
can arrest the criminal who possibly robbed a jewelry
shop and then DEFINITELY broke into my home.

Something about this doesn't feel right, like there's a
missing piece to the puzzle. But if the boy gets locked
behind bars, so will any chance of figuring out what's
REALLY going on here. If I'm going to get answers, I'll
have to extract them from the young man myself.

"Okay," says the officer, seemingly convinced. "Well, if
you do see anything suspicious, please call this number."

He hands me a card with a hotline for sending
anonymous tips, which I pocket just in case things
upstairs go south. Now, I just need to get him to leave so
I can do some investigating of my own.

"Yes, sir. Have a nice day." I close the door. *click*

The policeman leaves, apparently taking me at my word.
I guess it'd be kind of crazy for a girl to cover for the
thief that just broke into her house to hide from the law,
huh? Anyway, I'll hurry back to ask for the full story.

Little does the boy know that even though the police
are gone, he's not off the hook just yet...

Episode 7

Last time, a policeman had come to my door. Don't ask
me why, but for some reason I've decided to cover for
the suspected jewel thief who's hiding out in my room.

...At least until he's had a chance to plead his case.
The officer buys my story and leaves, but the boy is
still upstairs. So, I hurry back to ask him for the full
story.

I assume he was listening in on my conversation, which
means there's no telling what he's about to do next.
I'd better be careful... *creak*

"Sorry for the wait." Huh? His mug looks untouched.
So what WAS he getting up to while I wasn't watching?
Either he was snooping in my room, or eavesdropping.

"You haven't drunk any tea?" I ask, trying to act calm
and friendly even while I'm screaming internally. If this
guy IS dangerous, I don't want to get on his bad side.

"It'll get cold," I smile and say. But when he seems to
react with genuine surprise, I relax a little. Maybe he
just didn't like tea and was only trying to be polite.

"Would you rather have coffee instead?" I ask.
There I'd gone, letting my imagination run away.
Just like with the book. The boy mumbles something
until he's interrupted by his own rumbling stomach.

Whether this boy is guilty or innocent, I doubt he'll be
willing to open up to me on an empty stomach, so I say,
"I'm guessing you're hungry. It's a little early for supper,
but I could eat too. I'll go make something, so you can
relax here till then."

Little do I know as I head back downstairs, the quickest
way to a man's heart is through his stomach...

Last time, I realized how hungry the jewel thief in my
room must be after running from the law for so long.
In any case, I leave the boy in the room, descend the
staircase, and return to the kitchen. For tonight's
dinner I'll be preparing him a gourmet, four-course
meal...NOT! Ha ha, as if! I have no idea what I'll
make. I guess I'll see what I have in the fridge.

*plunk* Is there anything I can use? Oh right, I do have
curry powder. Curry rice is looking like a pretty good
candidate, then. What else do I have? Onigiri, apples,
honey, pineapples, cheese, potatoes, and carrots.

Yeah, this should make for some darn good curry rice.
Curry rice it is! First I have to cut everything up
to the right size (except the rice balls, of course).

Then I throw it all in a pot to boil.
*chop* *stir* *sizzle* *cooking sounds*
*tick* *tick* *tick* ... *DING!*

That should do it! It'll be good to go after I let it sit
for a while. Oh wait, do I have enough tableware?
*rustle* Oh, good. There's enough for two.

and dashing a whole new meaning...

Last time, I started making curry rice for the hungry
boy in my room... The hungry boy who, according to the
police, stole jewelry from the department store and has
been on the run since.

Hmmm, it'll take a few minutes before the curry rice is
done. What should I do in the meantime? Is the boy
really just sitting up there doing nothing?

Well, he didn't do anything to mess up my room the last
time I left him alone, so at least I don't have to worry
about that...I think. And there's 'Fairy and Me' to help
him pass the time, so he should be fine. He seemed
pretty interested in it; maybe he's reading it now?

Oh, right. He was holding the book when I brought in the
tea, but the moment he saw me, he put it back on the
table and apologized simply for looking at it.

Hmmm... Is the stuff in the pot bubbling now? I'll try
a little taste. *sip* Mmm, that's good. And the rice
is done, too. Then I'll bring it all up to my room
and we'll have us a nice little picnic.

...But maybe I made too much? It's so heavy, I can't carry
it with one hand. I'll just have to use both hands--
Oh, great. Now I can't even open the door without
dropping the whole pot. This is just perfect.

"Excuse me," I call out. "Could you open the door?"

Last time, I made so much curry rice that I couldn't
carry it all in one hand, let alone turn the doorknob
into my room. I try calling out to the boy, and he
quickly opens the door and holds it for me.
I look around the room...

'Fairy and Me' seems to have been moved a bit,
and the TV's been turned on, but nothing else appears
different. Maybe he tried watching TV but couldn't find
anything good on, so he looked at 'Fairy and Me'?
(Or maybe it's the opposite.)

Whatever the case, it looks like he hasn't done anything
suspicious...yet. Oh, that's right. I forgot to thank him
for opening the door.

"Thank you so much," I say, but at first my guest doesn't
respond. He seems to be sniffing the smell coming from
the pot instead of listening to me.

"Is that curry rice?" he asks, eyes widening as his
nostrils flare with hunger.

"Yes," I reply, putting the tray on the desk.
I take a plate and put some rice and curry on it.

"I don't know if it's to your tastes," I warn him
as I pass over the food, "but here you go!"

"Thanks. I'll dig right in." He takes the plate
and REALLY starts chowing down.

Little do I know, this may very well be his last meal
as a free man...

Episode 11

Last time, I brought up the curry rice I'd made to my
room. Was the boy reading 'Fairy and Me' while I was in
the kitchen? It's hard to say, but now he's wolfing down
his plate, so at least he likes my cooking.

When he finally speaks, it's through a mouthful of rice.
"This. Is. Delicious!"

"Really? I'm glad. I made plenty so eat as much as you
like." He really does seem to be enjoying it. Almost like
he could eat it forever. (Well, hunger IS the best spice...)

I'm a little hungry myself, so I spoon some food onto my
plate-- Wait, his plate is already empty! Poor guy
must've been starving. There's a lot, so he might as
well have his fill.

"Do you want seconds?" I ask. He seems hesitant,
and doesn't say anything right away. Maybe it's
because he doesn't actually like the taste?

I start second-guessing myself when he when he says,
"Yeah. I mean, yes please."

Sheepishly, he extends his plate out to me. I guess he DID
like the food and was just hesitating, after all.

Little does he know how happy that makes me...

The boy quickly finishes his first helping of curry rice,
so I ask if he wants seconds. 

He hands me his empty plate, looking more than a little
embarrassed. I guess he was just hesitating after all.
I take his plate, put more food on it, and pass it.

"Here you go," I say. "Enjoy!"

"Thank you." He takes the plate from me
and immediately starts digging in again...
Perhaps he really is enjoying it.

Soon, the boy leans back and pats his stomach.
"Whew, I'm stuffed. Thanks for the meal."


I ogle at the empty pot and rice container and say,
"You must've been hungry." (An understatement.)

"What can I say?" he jokes. "I'm a growing boy."

Little does the boy know, his joke was so funny
I forgot to laugh...

Episode 13

Last time, the boy in my room ate not one, but two
heaping helpings of the curry rice I threw together. He
seems to be satisfied now, so I allow myself to relax...
and if he really is a jewel thief on the run from the law,
then he won't be able to run far on a full stomach.

Honestly, it's nice to cook for someone who likes my food
so much they lick the bowl clean. And now I don't have
to worry about dealing with leftovers, I guess.

"I mean, I was definitely hungry," he says, "but it tasted
so good that I just couldn't help myself."

Just as I open my mouth to tell him that it's fine,
he cuts me off anyway and adds, "Sorry, I feel like
I ended up eating your portion too."

"No, not at all," I assure the boy. "I wasn't even
all that hungry, remember?" The boy bashfully waves
his hand a bit, but one serving really was enough.

"Seriously, though. That was amazing," my guest gushes.
"You're a really good cook."

"Well, I've been living alone this whole time," I confess.

"So there's no one else to make food for me. I handle all
the cooking and chores by myself, so of course I'd get
good at it." Even this guy could hear my bitterness.

I hadn't meant to be such a buzzkill, but now the boy
looks like he feels bad for giving me a simple compliment.
It really isn't a big deal, though.

Little do I know, he can see right through me...

Episode 14

The boy eats a ton of curry rice and seems to be full
now. But now he's prying into my past.

"All alone, in this big house?" the boy asks.
"What about your parents?"

"I used to live with my mom, but three years ago...
she passed away in an accident."

I must be making a face like he hit a nerve, because, well,
he kind of did. It really is lonely living by myself, after
all. But he does look kinda curious, so I'll tell him more.

"Oh... I'm so sorry." He looks really apologetic for a bit,
then he seems confused. Is he wondering about my dad?

"It's okay," I grumble. "It happened a long time ago.
Dad's abroad for work, but he only cares about his job."

I clench my fists and take a deep breath before saying
through gritted teeth, "Well, he didn't even come back
when Mom died."

Whenever I talk about him, I just can't help but get
a little ticked. I don't even care that I'm dumping
my family's dirty laundry to a stranger.

"He's never sent any letters or called," I fume,
"but every month I get enough money to live
comfortably, so I assume he must still be alive."

Little do I know, I'd completely forgotten that I was
supposed to be the one asking the questions...

Episode 15

Last time, I was telling the suspected jewel thief in my
room about how I live alone in this house (I don't know
what came over me, honest!). Now I'm getting steamed
over my deadbeat dad, and the boy is trying to help me
feel better. Could this day GET any weirder...?

"You didn't think about going to live with your dad when
your mom passed away? Couldn't you have gone to live
with other relatives?"

Wait, if he came here because he knew about my
situation, then he should already know the answer
to that. He must be innocent...NOT!

Ha ha, as if. I tell the boy that even if I moved in with
my dad, it'd be more of the same. His work is his only
passion, I explain, so he always works late and just sleeps
through the few vacations he gets. So I'd be just as
alone there, too. For a minute, there's silence.

"But don't you get lonely?" asks the boy.

I can't help but admit, "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.
But my relatives only act nice to me because they're
trying to get at my dad's money. I'd rather live alone
than with a bunch of bloodsucking backstabbers."

Little do I know, the boy is muttering under his breath
about rich people and their skewed priorities...

Episode 16

Last time, I was telling the boy my life's story.
It's not a terribly happy one, so the mood after
that pleasant dinner has really plummeted.

"What if a stranger comes knocking at your door?"
the boy asks, oblivious to the fact that he IS
a stranger who JUST came knocking at my door.

"I suppose I let them in and feed them," I joke.
"But now I'm not alone. So I'm not lonely."

The boy appears to be taken aback by that answer.
That's only natural. I'm a little shocked myself,
so I'm sure it's even weirder to someone else.

He asks, "Why? How do you know I'm not
just another backstabbing bloodsucker
who only likes you for your money?"

When he says it like that, it only further convinces me
that he isn't a bad person.

"I don't," I reply, looking him right in the eye with a
mischievous smile. "But at least now I know you like me."

And when I say it, I feel like it must be true. He hasn't
been bending over backwards to be nice to me, but he
hasn't been mean, either. He's just a normal boy.

No, I know it's weird to prefer a stranger and fugitive
to my own relatives. Yet I can't help but feel that way.

Just as I'm thinking that, the TV that's been droning
quietly in the background catches our attention with
a special report.

Little do I know, it's about the strange young man
to whom I'm speaking at this very moment...

Episode 17

Last time, I was admitting to myself--and to my guest--
that I'm not as lonely with him around. Then suddenly,
a breaking news story flashes onto my TV screen.

"For our next story," says the reporter, "A priceless
jewel was stolen from the Midtown Mall yesterday...
Thankfully, the culprit was spotted and fled the scene
before any further damage could be inflicted on people
or property." That confirms the policeman's story.

Yeah, they have to be talking about this boy. Now that
we've both seen what the news is saying, he has to tell
me the reason why he came here, or I'm calling 9-1-1.

"But the culprit escaped and is still at large. Those
living in the area around the Midtown Mall are advised
to stay indoors and remain cautious. The suspect is
described as yadda, yadda, yadda..."

The description and composite sketch I saw earlier
leave no doubt that this boy has been accused of robbing
the local jewelry store. Yeah, THAT jewelry store.
No way can him coming here be a coincidence.

"So you came all the way to my house to hide?" I ask,
finally ready to get some answers out of this suspected
criminal. If he hasn't done anything wrong, then I'll do
whatever I can to help him prove his innocence. But if
he can't even bother to deny the allegations...

"Well," stammers the boy. "Not this house specifically,
I just needed a place to lie low. It's not like I picked
your place on purpose, or anything like that."

Little does he know, he couldn't have picked a worse
place to hide in the whole wide world...

Last time, the incident the boy got caught up in
yesterday was being broadcast on the news. Now it
looks like he wants to say something. Go on, I think
to myself. I'll listen to whatever you have to say.

"Look, I didn't plan on coming here, okay? It just sorta
happened. And I promise, I didn't steal anything."
He seems to wince, as if bracing for rejection.

"Yeah, I don't think you'd do something like that.
I believe you." THAT one throws him for a loop.
He looks like he can't believe how easily I'm
trusting him. I can hardly believe it, myself.

"Um..." He pauses for a moment, then smiles.
"You really believe me?"

"Yeah. I mean..." My words trail off as I pick up the book
titled 'Fairy and Me' from off the desk. He seems
confused when I try handing it to him, so I'll just
have to explain what I'm getting at.

Now that I've accepted his story, I'm sure he'll believe
that I know he's pure of heart because he could see
'Fairy and Me', whereas the police officer couldn't see
it when it was right in front of him...

...NOT! Just kidding, ha ha.

Obviously, it's not because of a magic book that I know
he's innocent. Little does the boy know, it's due to the
time we've spent together...

Last time, the fugitive who's been hiding out in my house
promised that he didn't steal anything, in spite of all the
evidence to the contrary. But now that I'm telling my
guest I believe him, it seems like HE'S the one having
a hard time trusting ME.

To prove my point, I offer him 'Fairy and Me,' which
I think he's been reading every time I leave the room.
He looks back and forth between the book and me.

"So you really can see the book, after all. Right?"
Hmmm, he still looks like he doesn't understand.

Ha ha, oh well. I'll just show him. I open the front cover
and show him the first page. There, it says:

------------------------------------------------------
     Anyone who reads this book all the way
     to the end will have one wish granted,
     no matter how far-fetched or fantastic.
  But only those of pure heart can see this book.
------------------------------------------------------

"When you came to this house," I explain, "I dropped this
book in surprise. But you picked it up for me, which
meant you can see it. If you can see it, you must be pure
of heart. And if you have a pure heart, you can't have
stolen that jewel."

Little does the boy know, I only half-believe what I'm
saying, myself. Whether or not the book is magic,
his reaction to it will tell me everything...

Last time, I explained to the boy that I trusted him
because of what was written in a magical tome called
'Fairy and Me'...NOT! Ha ha, as if.

"No one with a pure heart would steal unless they had
a good reason for it" is the explanation I feed him.
Of course I don't believe in a book that grants wishes,
but right now it's the best way to explain the leap
of faith I'm taking with a nice guy who's had a run
of bad luck and needs a little help.

"But how can you trust people--and what they write--
on blind faith?" I'm sure he means well, but that
question honestly kind of ticks me off.

"Blind faith? No, my eyes are wide open," I snap.
"I'm good at watching people, and picking up the little
cues they don't even know they're giving."

That shuts him up, and I immediately regret being so
harsh to the poor kid. As I'm mulling over an apology,
he changes the subject with a different question.

"Um, earlier, you were talking like me coming here was
more than a coincidence. What'd you mean by that?"

Up until now I'd been willing to just overlook the
elephant in the room, but he's been ignoring it
for so long I'm starting to think he's not lying.

Does he really not know a thing about me? Little does
this boy know, I've got the potential to be his
guardian angel, or his worst nightmare...

is who he says he is. I've been suspecting him of having
an ulterior motive for so long, giving my uninvited guest
the benefit of the doubt feels like finally being able to
exhale again after holding my breath for a long time.

"Hmm. So you really don't know who I am?" I ask.
He shakes his head 'NO' like a scared puppy.
All right, I tell myself. I can trust him.

"Then I guess I should start from the beginning.
I told you my dad's always busy with work, right?"

"Right," he says, nodding a little nervously.

"See, he's kind of a big deal in real estate. As in, he owns
the entire Midtown Mall. So I thought you'd looked up
my address and came here on purpose. But I guess I was
wrong. What a coincidence, huh?"

Mouth agape, the boy takes a moment to digest all that
information before saying, "Yeah, it really is."

But honestly? I'm kind of seriously entertaining the
possibility that the power of 'Fairy and Me' is what
brought us together...NOT!

Ha ha, as if. Little do I know, sometimes the simplest
answer isn't always the right one...

"Anyway," I tell him, "I'll do what I can to help you.
The missing jewelry's in your bag, right? Then let's
figure out how it got in there."

"Thank you so much," he replies. "But how do we even
start? I can't exactly stroll on up to the scene
of the crime and ask the clerks."

"I'll ask the manager to show me the security tapes,
and see if I can't spot anything suspicious."
Assuming the footage wasn't confiscated as police
evidence. Still, it's got to be worth a shot.

"I getcha," he nods in agreement. "You are the owner's
daughter, after all."

"Okay, I'll go ahead and call the store."
I stand and say, "Wait here a moment."

call, this informal investigation will lead us down

Last time, I decided to ask the manager of the jewelry
store if I could borrow the tapes from yesterday's
security camera feed.

*ka-chick* There's a staticky voice on the other line.
"Midtown Mall department store, jewelry section.
How can I help you?"

"Hellooo," I intone in my best 'adult businessperson'
voice. "I'm calling on behalf of the owner. The boss
wants to see the tapes from yesterday's security
cameras. Yes, all of them. As soon as possible, please...
Yes, that's right. Thank you, goodbye." *beep*

Okay, that actually went better than expected! I head
upstairs to update my friend. But when I get back to my
room, I notice he hasn't even budged from the exact
same position I left him in. Is he really that nervous?
I tell him the good news.

"I called the manager. They'll deliver the tapes here, so
we just have to wait." Then, on a whim, I pass 'Fairy and
Me' and ask, "Wanna read this book to pass the time?"

The boy looks like I just asked him if he has three heads
and sputters, "Any reason why this book, specifically?"

"You've been stealing glances at it all day," I reply.

That's not 100% true, but if he watches TV, he's liable
to see another news report about his case and get all
panicky again. Luckily, he doesn't need much coaxing.

"Huh. Was I? Well, sure," he concludes. "Might as well!"
Little do I know, the boy's just as eager to get back to
reading the book as I am to see him get to the end of it...

Last time, I suggested the boy read 'Fairy and Me'
while we wait for the jewelry store manager to deliver
the tapes to my house. Eventually, he nods and takes the
book, then begins to read...until he looks back up at me.

"Um, what's up?" he asks, but there's nothing up. I hadn't
even realized I'd been staring at him until he got all
flustered about it.

"Don't mind me," I say. "Just keep reading."

Ha ha, as if. If someone was gawking at me, I know
I wouldn't be able to read a single sentence. And yet,
after a little while, the boy gets so engrossed in the
book that he really does forget I'm sitting here.

...Now I'M the one losing track of time, simply ogling
at this nice young guy. Just as the sun is setting,
I hear a *DING DONG*. Leaving the boy to his reading,
I tiptoe downstairs and open the front door.

"Hello," I say to the manager, who came to deliver the
tapes personally. I guess he wants to make sure my dad
doesn't blame him for yesterday's incident.

"Thanks very much," I tell the manager as he leaves.
"Okay, bye." With that, I go back inside and upstairs.

I enter the room and immediately say,
"May I ask something?"

Last time, the manager himself had delivered the tapes
directly to my house. Once I'm back upstairs, I swing
the door open to my room and ask the boy a question.

"Yeah, sure. What did you wanna ask?" He seems a little
surprised, probably wondering how long he was sitting
and reading in one spot.

"Would you like to watch the security tapes?" I ask.
With that, he looks so excited he could do a backflip.

"Oh, they're here already? You should've said something
earlier. Of course I want to watch the footage. Where
do we even begin?" His questions tumble out rapidly.

I chuckle and say, "They gave us the tapes for the whole
day, so there's no point watching the ones that don't
have you in a starring role." That calms him down.

"Good point," the boy agrees. "Lemme fill you in on
what I remember from yesterday."

"Excellent idea." I start taking mental notes.
"What time did you get to the mall?"

"About two o' clock in the afternoon. After entering
through the main entrance, I went straight upstairs
to the department store on the fourth floor."

"That'll narrow things down," I say. "What then?"

"Then, I randomly browsed around the jewelry counter
for a bit, bought a brooch, and then went to leave.
But there was this weird noise (a security alarm,
I think?) and then a nearby clerk tried to stop me."

"Okay," I nod and stand up to head for the door.
"So let's look at the tapes from around that time."

Little do I know, reviewing security footage for the
tiniest of clues is a lot less thrilling in real life
than they make it appear on TV...

until he looks around the room and realizes there's
no VCR player in here.

Once he gets up to follow me, I guide my friend to the
entryway, where I left the cardboard box that the
manager delivered. As I open the box and begin pulling
out the most pertinent cassettes, I tell him my strategy
for minimizing our workload.

"This should be everything the department store's
camera picked up yesterday. Let's just grab the ones
that are at and around the time you remember being at
the mall. Bringing them all would only wear us out."

Once we've got the right tapes, I ask him to carry them
for me as I lead him down the hall to what used to be my
father's study. Now that he doesn't even bother coming
home if he can help it, it's basically just become a place
to store all his old junk.

"This the place?" he grunts, as he begins to lower the
heavy pile of videos into a neat stack so that we can
review them in chronological order.

"Yes," I confirm, rubbing my hands in anticipation.
"Now let's get started."

Little do I know whether the tapes will hold some vital
clue to clearing my friend's name, but it's his only hope,

Episode 27

Last time, the boy and I were preparing to watch the
footage from the jewelry store's security camera. I load
the tape into my dad's old VCR player, flick on the
screen, and start watching.

Even after narrowing down the number of tapes to
review, it takes a while for us to pick out the boy among
the crowds. Soon enough, however, we've got a pretty
good grasp of the window in which the incident
occurred.

Sitting side by side, we watch everything from when the
boy enters the jewelry store to when he leaves. For the
most part, it goes exactly as the boy remembered. But
no one approaches him until the alarm goes off and the
clerk tries to stop him.

What's up with that? I see the clerk take off the
security tag from the brooch the boy had just bought, so
it wasn't a simple mistake. But if the alarm's not being
triggered by the brooch, then it wouldn't sound unless
someone had slipped the stolen jewelry INTO his bag.

All I can conclude so far is that SOMETHING must have
happened. But what? I guess I'll rewind and watch the
part where the clerk stops him again.

"What's wrong?" he asks with an edge of desperation in
his voice. "Did something stand out to you?"

"Yeah," I murmur. "Up until this point, it doesn't look like
anyone put the stolen jewelry into your bag."

My eyes are straining to pick up every little detail as
I say, "Of course, it doesn't look like you stole it either.
But the security alarm went off. It's strange.
Something else must be..."

Huh? It looks like the clerk moved. Hmmm, but they're a
little ways away from the boy. Did something happen
when the clerk moved near the entrance of the store?
No one else is around but the clerk.

Little do I know, the clue I need is hiding in this footage.
If only I can find it...

Last time, the boy and I decided to watch the
security tapes, to make sure he didn't steal anything.

As I'm watching one of the security tapes, I notice
something I hadn't before. Something even the police
must have missed. The realization that comes with my
discovery is so mind-blowing that I can't help but gasp.

"What is it?" he asks. "Did you figure something out?"

He's so eager he looks like he's about to jump out of his
own skin, but I raise a finger and say, "Wait a moment!"

I rewind again and watch the same few seconds... Yep,
there it is. When the boy is about to leave, the clerk
sticks their hand outside the store. And it looks like
they're holding something.

"So that's what happened," I think out loud.
"Okay. Watch this part."

After rewinding again, I point to the clerk standing by
the entrance. This time, the boy's own eyes light up in
realization.

"They're holding something," says the boy. "So I didn't
set off the alarm, it was an employee?"

"Bingo. I think this clerk is holding a piece of jewelry,
sets off the alarm as you're leaving, then slips it in your
bag while pretending to search you."

It's a wild and frankly unbelievable series of events, now
that I've said it out loud, but that appears to be exactly
what we're watching. Just to make absolutely certain,
I rewind it one more time.

"See? Right here!" I hit the pause button at just the
right moment so that the screen lingers on the clerk
slipping the stolen jewelry into the boy's bag.

Now we know whodunnit! There's just one problem.

Episode 29

Last time, the boy and I were watching the jewelry
store's security footage when I finally made the
discovery that blew this whole case wide open. As it
turns out, the real culprit is the clerk who was working
at the jewelry store while the boy was shopping there.

"So now we know who did it," I say. The clerk had taken
an item from their own shop, waved it outside the door
to set off the alarm as the boy was leaving, then placed
that very item into my friend's bag while pretending
to frisk him. What a twist, huh?

The boy follows up with our next logical query.
"But now the real question is, why?"

Looking at the clock, I realize it's already midnight.
The store's obviously closed, so we can't track down
that clerk. And now that we know the boy's innocent,
there's no rush. Besides, I'm exhausted. All I want
now is to curl up in my bed and fall asleep.

"I don't know," I sigh. "But it's getting late.
Let's leave that riddle to unravel tomorrow."

Hmmm. I was about to ask him to go home, but if I make
him leave now, the police might find him. It'd be better
for everyone if he could prove his innocence WITHOUT
the trauma of jailtime and a lengthy trial.

"Okay, I'd say it's time to get cleaned up and head
to bed. Wait here, I'll have the bath ready in a few."

With that, I stand up and leave the room before the boy
can reply. I've decided that I'm going to let him stay the
night here. As awkward as he can get, I'm worried he'd
refuse if I offered. But I can't let him get into legal
trouble because of something MY dad's employee did,
so I'm not going to give him much of a choice.

Little do I know as I draw a bath, he's reading
'Fairy and Me' at this exact moment...

"Sorry for the wait, it's right this way."
Oh, he was reading 'Fairy and Me.' At this rate, he'll

him the run-down.

"Here it is. I'll throw your clothes in the wash, so just

something for my guest to wear...but what? My clothes
are too small for him (and maybe he wouldn't feel
comfortable in girl's clothes?), so I'll have to give him
some of my dad's pajamas. But they might be too big?

I guess it'll be fine. It's better to wear a shirt three
sizes too large than three sizes too small, right? Ah, well,
I won't worry about it. I fish around the dresser and
find some nice pajamas, then leave them in the changing
room for my guest to put on after he's all dried off.

"Um, I'm leaving a change of clothes for you here," I say.
"But they're my dad's, so they're probably a little big on
you." That might've been an understatement, but
whatever.

"That's fine," the boy replies. "Thanks!"

I wonder if it really will be fine? They're seriously huge.
Well, I'll go ahead and put his laundry in the washing
machine. Dumping the dirty clothes into the machine,
I put in detergent and water, then let it spin...

*whir* *whir* That should get it started. Now I need
to get his bed ready, and he'll be all set.

Little does he know that when I have a guest over, I'm
so hospitable that I even leave a mint on the pillow...

Episode 32

Last time, I got a change of clothes for my friend while
he took a bath. My dad's pajamas are several sizes
too big, but the boy seems fine with that.

I guess I'll just get my dad's old cot ready for him, then?
Okay, I guess I'll set it up in the parlor. (I feel like
he could sleep in Dad's room at this point, but whatever.)

*whoosh* That should do it. Yeah, that looks pretty good.
*splash* Oh, sounds like he just got out of the bath.
Then I'll wait a bit and call him over here.

Hmmm, is he done changing by now? I leave the room to
find him just coming out of the changing room. I try not
to laugh at how silly he looks in the oversized outfit.

"Oh, you're done already? I guess Dad's PJs are more
than just 'a little big.' But that's all I've got,
so I hope it's okay. Just for tonight?"

He smiles in return and says, "I figured the owner of the
Midtown Mall would have big shoes to fill, but it's his
PJs I should've been worried about!"

We laugh at the joke as I take him back to the parlor
and tell him, "Oh, and I got a bed ready for you here,
so you can sleep in this room."

"Wow! You've really thought of everything. Thank you
so much. Well, I guess it's time to call it a night."

Little do we know, this night is just getting started...

Episode 33

Last time, the boy had gotten cleaned and dressed. Now
we're back in the parlor, where I've set up a cot for him
to sleep on tonight. It's the least I can do.

He seems super grateful, so I brush it off and say,
"I couldn't let you sleep on the floor. Okay, I'm
going to go take my bath now."

Oh, maybe I should warn him not to peek...NOT! Ha ha,
as if. Maybe I'll just tease him a little. So I go back
to the parlor and find him reading 'Fairy and Me'.

"By the way," I poke my head in and say.
"Yes?" he asks, looking up. "What is it?"
"No peeking," I reply.

He looks like he doesn't know what to say. Uh-oh, 
did I just give the poor guy a brain aneurysm?
I guess I shouldn't tease him TOO much.

"Just kidding. Someone with a pure heart wouldn't do
that. Okay, I'm actually going to take a bath now."

Little does my guest know that as adamantly as he's
insisting that he'd never peek, I honestly wouldn't mind
THAT much if he did...

Episode 34

Last time, I'd left my guest in the parlor so that I could
take a bath. I'm lying in the tub, thinking about the boy
in my house and the mystery we'd recently solved.

*splash* Whew, that was a good bath. *wipe wipe*

Better get changed...and done! I guess I'll go see what
he's doing. I'm eager to see how far he's gotten in 'Fairy
and Me,' so I stroll back into the parlor room.

When I open the door, he's so focused on reading that he
doesn't even notice me come up right behind him. For a
minute or two, I simply stand and watch.

*fwmp* He closes the book. Does that mean he's done?
"Um, did you finish reading it?" I eventually ask.
My friend whips around to look at me in shock.

"S-Sorry. I didn't mean to surprise you. So, um, did you
finish reading it?" He nods. Okay, next question...

"How was it? Did you like it?" He nods again.
And now for the final question, although I'm
pretty sure I already know the answer.

"Cool! So, then...what did you wish for?"

"Uh, if I tell you what it is, does that mean
the wish won't come true?"

Little does he know, that only applies to blowing out
your birthday candles...

Episode 35

Last time, the boy had finished reading 'Fairy and Me'
while I was taking my bath. Now I'm asking him what he
wished for, but he seems to be under the impression that
if you say what you wished for, it won't come true.

Isn't that for blowing out candles on a birthday cake?
I laugh and say, "That's not how it works, silly!"

"Oh," my friend says, blinking in surprise. "In that case,
I wished for my name to be cleared!"

I thought that might be what he'd wish for. But is it
what his heart TRULY desires? After we've already
found the evidence to prove that he's innocent?

"Great, I'm sure it'll come true tomorrow." It really is
great news, but it means that our time together will end
after today. (Well, we were really only together just
for today anyway.) Tomorrow I'll go back to being alone.
That's kinda sad. Maybe he'll stay with me? Oh, but...

"By the way," the boy ventures. "You read the whole
book too, right? Did you wish for something when you
got to the end?"

"I did. But before I tell you, um..." This is kind
of embarrassing, so it's hard to find the right way
to put this. "May I ask you a question?"

If he went to the jewelry store to pick out a gift for
someone he's dating, then I probably shouldn't tell him.
I'll ask him whether he's single or not.

"Of course," says my new friend. "What is it?"

"The jewelry you bought at the store yesterday..."
I steel my nerves and blurt, "Was it a gift for a girl?"


Little do I know, the answer is going to change
my life--and his--for the rest of our days...

Episode 36

Last time, my friend finished reading 'Fairy and Me,'
then told me that his wish was for everyone to realize
he hadn't stolen anything. As for my wish? Well...

Before I can bring myself to tell the boy what I wished
for, I ask him if the brooch he bought was a gift.

"Yeah, it was for a girl," he says, which makes my heart
sink into the pit of my stomach. But then he quickly adds,
"For my little sister, that is!"

His little sister? That's a pretty sudden introduction
of a new character.

"See, my little sister's birthday is coming up. Every year
she has a ginormous meltdown if I don't buy her
something. And even when I do, she'll still throw
a massive tantrum if she doesn't like what I got her."

Now this is getting to be a little TMI, but before I can
cut him off, he carries on. "So this year, I brought her
to the mall ahead of time to ask her what she wants.
That way, I wouldn't have to worry about choosing...
And the rest, I guess, is history."

"Then it isn't a gift for someone you're dating?"
I still had to ask, just to make sure.

"Nope," he says with a sigh. "I'm not dating anyone.
So, anyway, what DID you wish for?"

What? Then maybe I have a chance. Okay, I'll tell him.
So here it is, my heart laid bare for this boy to see:
"My wish...was to have a boyfriend with a pure heart."

I didn't really come right out and say that I wanted
HIM to be said boyfriend, but if he can't put two and
two together, well, maybe he's not really long-term
dating material, anyway...NOT!

Ha ha, as if. After thinking about it for a while, he nods.
"And I'm the pure-hearted guy who just happened to
knock on your door after you wished for one, huh?"

Oh my gosh. Is my wish coming true? Does he really
want to be with me? Or is he just fishing for the right
words to reject me without hurting my feelings?

The suspense is killing me until he finally says,
"Then I guess there's nothing else to say. If you'd
like me to be your boyfriend, my answer is..."

Little does he know, I already know the answer: YES!

Recently, one angler attested to catching a giant fish
well over three feet long. It's called a Huchen, and
appears to be the Guardian of downstream areas.

As luck would have it, the person who fished it up is a
great chef who specializes in Grilled Fish, Sashimi, and
Sushi. Why don't you all take a page out of their book and

Carp, which live in lakes, are worthy of being called
Guardians, but they're notoriously tricky to fish up. One
person who once caught a Carp was said to often ship
out entire schools of fish from their farm--over two
hundred in all.

Episode 37: To Tomorrow

After the giant white haze explodes,
nothing happens.

"Is it...over?"

"But what in the world WAS that thing?"

"Good question. We fought it and beat it without knowing
anything about it."

"Well, whatever it was, it was evil!
It ruined our summer break."

"Hmmm... Anyway, we beat it with some of our summer
break to spare, so all's well that ends well, I guess.
Wanna all hit up the pool again tomorrow?"

"Unfortunately, it looks like the pool's out of the
question."

"Why?"

He points in the direction of the pool, which has been
reduced to rubble. It must've been destroyed in the white
haze's explosion.

"..."

"If the pool's a no-go,
then let's go to the beach tomorrow instead!"

And so, the following day is one of waterside merriment,
as the team soaks up the summer sun on a well-deserved
day at the beach.

Prologue

Anyone who reads this book all the way to the end will
have one wish granted, no matter how far-fetched or
fantastic.

But only those of pure heart can see this book.

And right now, it's sleeping in a school library...<wait>

Episode 1

Right now, I'm in the school library. Mind you, I don't
especially enjoy reading, and it's not like I came here
to study.

Shirayuki Fuyutsuki: the library committee girl.
I come here every day to see her.

But I haven't seen hide nor hair of Shirayuki today.
Is that End of the Day Meeting running long?

I don't really have anything to do, so I start browsing the
bookshelves at random. Then, as if drawn by a mysterious
power, I pick up a book. The title?

"Fairy and Me."

Episode 1

I'm in the school library right now. I'm a library
committee member, so I help people borrow books in
addition to picking up a variety of odd jobs. Of course,
I love reading, and studying is my forte.

But today, I'm the only one in the library. Without
anything pressing on my agenda, I gaze at the bookshelves.

(Huh? Was this book always here?)

A book I don't remember seeing before catches my eye.
It's titled "Fairy and Me."

As if drawn by a mysterious power, I pick up a book. 
("Fairy and Me," huh? Well, it's already in my hands,
so I may as well read it.)

*flip*... *flip*...

(So, it'll supposedly grant any wish, huh? Life sure would
be easy if I could get whatever I wanted just by reading
this book. But if it really DOES grant wishes, then, well...
It would be great if Shirayuki would fall in love with me.)
"Excuse me... You can see that book?"
"Wha--?!"

(It grants any wish, hm? Life would definitely be easy if
I could get anything I wanted just by reading this book.
But supposing it IS true... I'd like a nice boyfriend.
Anyway,
I suppose I'll read the whole thing.)

Finally, I turn the last page and close the book.

"Um... Can you see that book?"
"Huh?"
She repeats her question. I don't understand what she
means, though.

...Ah!

(Oh, I get it! The part written in the beginning said that
only the pure of heart can see this book. That must be
what she means!)
"I...guess I have a pure heart?"
"Hee hee..."

"I'm so glad you understand. Have you read that book?"
I shake my head no.
(I just randomly happened to pick it up, so I've only read a
little bit. I admit I had toyed with the idea of reading the
whole thing, but...)
"Let me guess: were you just thinking that you might as
well read it since you'd bothered to pick it up?"
I look at her in shock.
"Your face says that you're curious about how I knew
that. That's because I've been here ever since you picked
up that book, but you were so absorbed in it that you
didn't notice me watching you. So I figured that if you
hadn't read it yet, you were at least thinking about
reading it."
(Oh, I get it.)

On the way home from school that day, I hear a voice in
the park. Curiosity getting the better of me, I go to
investigate, and I find a white puppy that's been
abandoned in a cardboard box, along with a boy.
"Poor thing. But we can't keep pets in my apartment
complex, so I can't take you home. Sorry, buddy.
Oh, but I CAN buy you some milk. Wait a sec!"
The boy says, dashing over to the nearby convenience
store.
(What a nice guy.)
I think, as I find myself walking up to the
abandoned puppy.

(About what?)
"I mean, will you borrow that book and read it at home,
or will you come here every day to read it?"
(Gimme a break... I haven't committed to do anything yet
here.)
"But you ARE planning on reading it, right? If you're
going to borrow it, there's a card (she shows me the back
of the book) here. All you have to do is write your class
number and name on it and give it to me."
This is the first time I've ever spoken to her, so I'm at a
loss for words, but she keeps talking as if it's the most
natural thing in the world...
"Well? Are you going to check it out?"
I take the card from the book and write my class number
and name on it.

away. Then, I take my scarf and wrap it around the
puppy, deciding to take it home with me.

I'm curious, so I end up following him.

Then he arrives at what must be his apartment building
and goes inside.
(So this is where he lives. *sigh* I wish I had a boyfriend
as nice as him.)

I'm curious about him, but I also have the puppy to think
about, so I go home.
When I get back, I find the puppy...
(Oh, he's sleeping. Hmmm, did he get sleepy after warming
up? Oh well. I'll feed him something when he wakes up.)

Two or three days later, the puppy makes a full recovery.

at least. And whether my wish is granted or not, I got to
talk with her, so...)
I wave goodbye to Shirayuki and leave the library.

something else happens. The boy appears in the library!

(What should I do? Wait, he probably doesn't know...
Oh, or did he figure out that I followed him? Shoot!
N-Now what?!) As my heart is quietly pounding,
I continue working as if nothing has happened.
(I'm putting returned books back on the shelves.)

I finish what I'm doing and glance over at the boy to see
him apparently studying. He doesn't seem to need me for
anything. That's a relief.

But for whatever reason, from then on, the boy starts
coming to the library every day.
(So he's nice AND passionate about his studies.
I like him even more now.)

(Come to think of it, it was snowing on the day I first saw
Shirayuki, too.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That day, on my way home from school, I heard something
in the park. I wondered what it was, and when I went to
look, I found a white puppy abandoned in a cardboard box.
I felt bad for it, but pets aren't allowed in the apartment
I live in, so I couldn't take it home. I figured that at the
very least, I could feed it something, so I went to the
nearby convenience store to buy milk. But when I got
back, there was a girl standing by the cardboard box the
puppy was in. It was Shirayuki.

One day, the End of the Day Meeting runs long, making
me arrive late to the library.
When I get there, I find the boy standing by himself in
front of bookshelf, gazing intently at a book.
(That book's "Fairy and Me." He seems pretty absorbed
in it, so I should be able to inch closer.)
He doesn't even notice when I creep right up beside him.
(Oh, I know! This is my chance to talk to him. We can talk
about "Fairy and Me.")
Then...I gather up my courage and talk to the boy.

"Poor thing, it must be cold."
Then, she picked up the puppy, brushed the snow off its
head, and wrapped her own scarf around it. Then she left,
taking it back to her house.

"A snowy day like this makes me remember... I think it
was a month ago now? I picked up a puppy in that park on
a snowy day like this. When I saw him shivering from the
cold in a cardboard box, I couldn't leave him there. I ended
up taking him home with me. He's really big now, but for
the first few days, he wouldn't eat much, and all he'd
drink was milk. I was really worried. Oh, here we are.
This is where you live. Well, see you later. And, um, I really
do hope your wish is granted."
She leaves without even giving me time to say thank you.

What exactly is written in this "Fairy and Me" book?
Let's take a peek.

Chapter 1

One day, when a human boy is taking a stroll through the
park, he chances upon a fairy girl. Gulping down the last
of his juice, he tries chucking the empty can into the
garbage, but misses spectacularly and hits a flower
blooming next to the garbage can!
"Owww. What was THAT for?!"
Underneath the flower is a four-inch tall girl with wings.
(Apparently, she's a fairy.)
The flower was crushed under the weight of the can the
boy threw, so now she has no home and no place to go.
The boy feels responsible and offers to let her stay at his
place until she finds a new home. And so, the boy and the
fairy start living together.

One day, while the fairy is playing outside, she is caught in
a sudden downpour. She quickly returns to the boy's
house, but she's soaking wet.
"Achoo!"
The fairy, stricken with fever, falls asleep while the boy
desperately tries to nurse her back to health.
Possibly thanks to his efforts, the fairy awakens the next
day fever-free, and can once again freely take flight.

The fairy is tickled pink by the boy's kindness, but at the

their obvious differences. Or so she thinks, at least.
Further complicating things, the boy ends up confessing
his love to a girl at his school, crushing the fairy's dreams.
Owing to bad luck and poor timing besides, the fairy
happens to witness the scene and decides to leave the
boy's house.

Fairy and Me (Rerun)

Chapter 5

The boy looks everywhere he thinks the fairy might be,
but turns up nothing. Where in the world could she have
gone? Is it possible she found a new home? His mind starts
racing, suddenly certain that she would have told him if
that was the case. He often thought of her as a loud
annoyance, but now that she's gone, he understands how
important she is to him. Resuming his search, he comes to
the park where they first met. And there, next to the
garbage can, is...

"Hey, Sis! Hey, Sis!"

"Yes?"

"Whatcha gonna teach me today?"

"Today, I think I'll talk about the mysterious traveling
merchant, Huang."

"Recently, Huang has been living with Zack over at
Mineral Beach. He runs a shop in Zack's front room.
There, you can buy:
- Seeds
- Pet Goods
- A Truth Jewel

The seeds Huang sells are ones you can't find in the
General Store. For the pet owners out there, he stocks a
Ball and a Disc. I think there's a book in the Library that
will teach you how to use them to train your pet. I don't
know much about the Truth Jewels, but I think something
will happen if you collect nine of them."

Just walk up to the spot you want to check and press the
Confirm Button. Of course, even if a spot looks like it
MIGHT have something, if there isn't really anything

hidden behind your house, it could prove more difficult to
find than you expect. Though, well... If you're the one who
put it somewhere odd like that, you'll likely remember

Fatigue build up too high, and even if you don't do any

- Eat food
- Soak in the Hot Spring
- Sleep

Any of those options will help relieve Fatigue and
restore Stamina. There are other ways besides just
those, but I will teach you about them some other time."

"All right. We were discussing the various things you can
do at the General Store, yes? Let's go over having your
items gift wrapped.

Firstly, you must remember to have the item you want
wrapped in your Bag--no need to hold it, though. Then,
walk up to and examine the wrapping counter. That will
bring up a list of items in your Bag, and you simply choose
the one you want to wrap."

"Can you wrap everything?"

At the Clinic, you can:
- Buy medicine
- Get an examination

If you'd like to buy medicine, talk to Elly from across
the counter. At first, the only available medicines are
Stamina Boosters and Caffeine. However, if you forage
for grasses on the mountain and ship enough of them,
the Clinic will eventually stock Stamina Booster XLs
and Super Caffeine."

"Huh? Why does shipping a lot of grasses give the Clinic
more stuff to sell?"

"That, I will go over tomorrow."

"All right. I believe you had asked why shipping a lot of
grasses foraged from the mountain will increase the
Clinic's stock of medicines.

The reason is simple if you think about it: the medicines
are made from the grasses. Now, they don't require
every single type of grass to make, but there are certain
ones you'll have to ship out."

"Really? Then, if I'm the one shipping the grasses, couldn't
I just keep them and make the medicines myself instead?"

"By concocting them in your Kitchen? Well, I guess
nobody's stopping you, so have at it. Moving on, I wanted
to discuss how you get an examination, but it looks like
we're out of time."

If you talk to Doctor from across the counter, he will
give you a physical examination. It's a simple affair that
tells you how much Stamina you have and how much
Fatigue you've built up. Be aware that the examination
does not heal you, though."

"Really? If it's not going to heal you, why bother with it
in the first place?"

"Well, you really don't have any other way of seeing how
much Fatigue you have built up, so I don't think it's
entirely meaningless. It's relatively cheap, too."

At the Church, you can:
- Make a confession
- Have curses dispelled

You can do both of these by entering the Confessional
(the left-hand door).  Now, when making a confession,
you first choose the sin you'd like to confess, and then
wait to see if it is forgiven. If your pleas are heard,
you'll get a little boost to your friendship with the rest
of the townsfolk, and you may even have your Stamina
healed a tad. If you aren't forgiven, well...life goes on.
Nothing particularly bad will happen, so there's no harm
in trying. Confess early and confess often, I always say."

With that point addressed, let's move on to today's topic:
having curses dispelled."

"What kind of curses are we talking about here?"

"Apparently, you can occasionally find cursed tools inside
the mines. If you equip one, it'll be bound to you,
preventing you from unequipping it. That's where the
Church comes in, as they can dispel the curse for you."

"Boy, there sure is some ghastly stuff lurking down in

can't get your food to-go. You'll automatically eat the
meal on the spot."

"Oh, but one big difference is that the menu never
changes, right?"

"That it does not. You see, the Beach Cafe isn't open for

"Yeah, but it just comes right back to me."

"Are you using it at a place where you can actually fish?"

"Huh? Are there places where you CAN'T fish?"

"You need to use it in places where there's water,
like the river, ocean, or mountain lake."

"I was trying to throw it inside my house and at a tree.
Was that wrong?"

"When you get a hit and the bobber gets tugged, you have
to press the button again to reel your catch in."

"Ohhh. So just leaving it in the water won't do anything."

"Right. And sometimes, even after you pull it back,
you won't have caught anything--or worse, all you'll

☆Going to School 1

*DING DONG*

On a morning like any other, I rang the doorbell on my
neighbor's house, letting Adrienne know I was there.

ADRIAN: Adrienne! G'morning!

A few moments later, I heard the sound of a window
opening. Adrienne peeked out of her second-story window,
her hair a floofy, bed-headed mess.

ADRIENNE: G'morning, Adrian! I'll be ready in a sec,
'kay?

That's Adrienne. She's my neighbor, my childhood friend,
and my girlfriend. I know what you're thinking--our
names sound exactly alike, and that DOES get confusing
at times, but so it goes.

Two minutes later...

ADRIENNE: Sorry to make you wait so long, Adrian. 

Adrienne came out, dressed in her school uniform.
The impressive bed-head I saw mere minutes before
was all but brushed out. Mostly.

Adrienne came out, dressed in her school uniform.
The impressive bed-head I saw mere minutes before
was all but brushed out. Mostly.

ADRIAN: C'mon, Adrienne. We hafta hurry, or we'll be
late.

Not that I have much room to talk, since I'm usually
running behind when I arrive to get her. But it WOULD
be nice if she could wake up a little earlier instead of
relying on me to ring her doorbell as a makeshift alarm
clock.

ADRIENNE: Yeah. Oh! Hey, Adrian? I wanna go shopping
after school today. Come with me?

Just like every morning, Adrienne was way too chipper
for someone who had just woken up.

ADRIAN: Sure. But what do you want to go shopping for
this time?

Adrienne twirled around in front of me, turning to watch
my face as she walked backwards to keep pace with me.
Honestly, Adrienne, you're gonna trip...

ADRIENNE: See, um, I wanna-- OOPS!

There, see? Because she wasn't paying attention to
where she was going, she caught her heel on something
and teetered, trying desperately not to faceplant on the
ground.

There, see? Because she wasn't paying attention to
where she was going, she caught her heel on something
and teetered, trying desperately not to faceplant on the
ground.

ADRIAN: Look out!

Reflexively, I lurched forward, reaching out to grab
Adrienne's wrist and steady her. But my strength was
lacking, so instead, she pulled me down with her,
and we both went tumbling down to kiss the pavement.

ADRIAN & ADRIENNE: OUCH!

*BONK* 

We smacked the ground, our heads bonking together hard
enough that I saw stars.

ADRIAN: Oof! Oww... Are you okay, Adrienne? ...Huh?
Wait a sec. Something's weird.

ADRIENNE: Yeah, I'm okay. Though my skull feels like it's
splitting. ...Huh? What the...? Why am I sitting right in
front of myself?

Good question. I, too, sat on the ground, staring right into
my own face. What in the world is going on here?

ADRIAN: Umm... Why am I right in front of myself?

ADRIENNE: I'm right in front of myself, too, so that can
only mean...

ADRIAN & ADRIENNE: We swapped bodies?!

I looked down at myself--at Adrienne's body. It was a
sight I was only used to seeing from a totally different
perspective. I thought of her walking alongside me or
spinning around to tease me. For her part, Adrienne was
taking in this phenomenon in much the same way.

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Oh my gosh, what do we do
now, Adrienne?

So what if I was a little panicky? Anybody would be in
this situation, don't you think?

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Don't ask me!

Hmm... Well, if bonking our heads together was what
caused the swap in the first place, maybe bonking them
again would switch us back?

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Well... Okay, hear me out
on this, but--

*BING BONG DING DONG*

I was interrupted by the chime of school bells in the
distance.

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Uh-oh! There's the
warning bell. For now, let's run to school and think
it over there.

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Huh?

Uh, isn't going to school like this a bad idea?

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): If we don't run, we'll be
late!

Sooo...apparently, Adrienne is more worried about being
late to school than the fact that we switched bodies.

Sooo...apparently, Adrienne is more worried about being

Personally, I'd say it's more important for us to switch
bodies back first, but...

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Then let's go! Oh, but we
probably shouldn't let anybody know this happened. Okay?

Adrienne pointed at her--well, my--body. 

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Yeah, it would be
awkward if people found out. But don't you think it'll be
hard to keep this a secret? 

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Naaah. I'm sure it'll work
out. Somehow.

Uh, I'm not so sure of that. I bet Adrienne didn't really
think this through. 

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): ...

Is this reeeally the brightest idea? I kinda think we
shouldn't even be bothering with school right now.

☆Going to School 7

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Phew! We managed to

We ran at a full sprint all the way from where we
bonked heads to our shoe lockers. How does she still have
so much energy? She always was a firecracker, that one.

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): *huff* *huff* Shoes...
Hafta make sure we don't mix 'em up...

The words were barely out of my mouth before Adrienne
reached into her shoe locker and pulled out her school
shoes. Normally, nothing would be wrong with that, but
we had to be careful now that our bodies were swapped.

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Oh, right! Riiight. Sorry.
I can't grab my usual ones. Silly me! I forgot.

Fortunately, nobody was around, so grabbing the wrong
shoes didn't cause the fuss I was afraid it might.

Adrienne opened the classroom door with a shwack and

(Though she was in my body, so to the rest of the world,
I was the one doing it.)

DANI: Morning, Adrian. Adrienne. I see you two showed
up together again, like the lovey-dovey couple you are.

We barely had two feet in the door before Adrienne's
best friend Dani came up to us. She and I would talk a lot,
too, since we were both such good friends with Adrienne.
(Though usually only when Adrienne was around. Rarely
did the two of us talk without her.)

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): G'morning, Dani!

Adrienne turned and gave an exuberant wave to her
friend, like she'd forgotten that she was actually in my
body. In fact, she probably HAD completely forgotten.

Me, though? I was so terrified people might realize we'd
body swapped that I couldn't even force a single word
out past my lips. (That's why I'd just bowed.)

DANI: Huh? Now THIS is unusual. What's got you so
down, Adrienne?

Urk!

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Huh? I'm not down at all.
I'm fit as a fiddle! Cool as a cucumber!

And she was. How the heck could she act so normally
when we had body-swapped not ten minutes prior?!

DANI: C'mon, Adrian. I didn't mean you. I meant the other
Adrienne!

Oh, right! I'm in Adrienne's body at the moment, so Dani

Oh, right! I'm in Adrienne's body at the moment, so Dani

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): I'm fine too, Dani.

I managed to answer her with something close to a
normal voice. To be honest, though, all I really wanted to
do was go home and not even bother with school today.

DANI: Really? Well, if you say so...

Thank goodness. After so many years of being friends
with Adrienne, I guess Dani learned to not sweat the
small stuff.

*BING BONG DING DONG*

Ah. There was the bell. First period was about to begin.

DANI: Aha! There's the bell. Talk to you later.

Saved by the bell! Literally! If I can help it, I want to
avoid talking with her as much as possible today. There's
no telling what I might accidentally do that could tip her
off to the fact that I'm not actually Adrienne.

Like always, our teacher started to take attendance,
reading down the class list in alphabetical order. 

TEACHER: Adrienne.

And of course, he usually starts with Adrienne--oh no!

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Heeere!

Adrienne. I know you have the same name, but you should
know by now that I always start with the girls. Be more
careful, would you?

Phew. It looks like our teacher didn't find it too weird
that Adrienne technically answered out of order. I guess
it's because that isn't the first time she's answered
when he was actually calling MY name. (Just to be clear,
I've never made that mistake.)

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Oops! My bad. Sorry!

That could've gone a lot worse, but I probably should have
spoken up quicker that time. Sorry, Adrienne.

Whenever we had to change classrooms, the two of us

we always did.

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Yeah. I think we have our
recorder test today.

Wait a sec. Recorder test? Um...does that mean I have to
use Adrienne's recorder? And doesn't that count as an
i-indirect kiss? ...No. Wait. I'm in HER body, so would that
really count? I'm not sure it does...but does it?

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Adrian, move it! The
teacher will be there any minute!

While I was letting my mind wander into the gutter,
Adrienne had grabbed her things and left the room.

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Oh! Right. I'm coming.

I quickly grabbed my recorder and textbook and dashed
out of the room after Adrienne.

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Oh, that's right! We have
P.E. for third period today, don't we? Oooh, somebody

Adrienne whispered that to me, waggling her eyebrows.
Apparently, she actually remembered that we swapped
bodies this time and kept her voice down so nobody
overheard. (We'd be in real trouble if anyone found out.)

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): ...

She was right, though. We did have P.E. today. Two
classes generally have P.E. together in the same period,
so that the boys and girls can use the two classrooms as
separate changing rooms. (We had already come from
the music room and were standing in front of our
classroom.)

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): I-I really don't think this is
a laughing matter, Adrienne. I know that I'm technically
you right now, but it's probably a really bad idea for me

Nobody will notice a thing! 

Closely observe them, huh...?

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Easier said than done.

I will admit that a part of me is not at all opposed to the
idea of watching...

But right as that thought pops into my head, Dani
appears!

DANI: Hm? What're you up to, Adrienne? I know you and
Adrian are two peas in a lovey-dovey pod, but you DO still
hafta change separately.

We know that. But--

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Yeah, we know. Okay, you
two. Out! Out! Go to your own classroom to change.

Adrienne pushed both Dani and I towards the classroom

states of undress. Heck, Dani was standing right next to
me as she changed.

DANI: Hm? What's wrong, Adrienne? You're beet-red.

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Um! I-It's nothing.

than Adrienne get changed!)

Dani leaned in close, peering at my face. (I reeeally wish
she wouldn't do that when she's only half-dressed!)

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): I'm fine. Really.

but did it HAVE to be running...?

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): *FLOP*

Wah! My leg cramped up, making me crumple to the
ground.

Dani, already on her way back from the turning point,
saw me lying on the ground and dashed up to me.

She quickly traded places with Dani, slipping her shoulder

Oh. Right. Our course took us around the entire campus

She picked me up (well, technically herself, since she was

If Adrienne went back to class now, our teacher would

she'd make a fool of herself. (See, Adrienne wasn't that

What should I do? Should I just go back to class?

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Hmm...yeah. I should
go back.

Given the time, when I got back to the classroom, math
would effectively be over and it'd be lunchtime anyway.
Yeah. That sounds like a plan. Then I could sit down and

out to go to the restroom and forgot to lock up.)

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): I hope Adrienne is doing
okay. Fingers crossed the teacher didn't pick on her too
much.

Given how often he made me answer questions on a
normal day, it would almost be weird if he HADN'T called
on her at least once. I really hope she didn't do or say
anything weird...

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): I'd better hurry back.

And there's the bell. It seems like nothing major happened,
so all's well that ends well, I guess.

day out, so the lawn was actually a rather pleasant place
to sit.

DANI: Bon appetit, guys.

Dani and I settled down on the lawn and pulled out our
own lunches.

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's Body): Urk...!

Opening the lid of Adrienne's lunch, I was greeted by a
sea of crimson that spread to all four corners of the
lunchbox. That's right. She's a real spice fiend, isn't she?
Me, though... I can barely handle black pepper, let alone
whatever THIS is. Farewell, cruel world...it's been real...

DANI: Hm? Aren't you hungry, Adrienne?

And of course Dani, being such a close friend of
Adrienne's, knows how much she loves spicy foods.
If I don't eat this, she'll definitely think something is up.

☆Lunch Recess 3

Dani knows how much Adrienne loves spicy foods.
If I don't eat this, she'll definitely think something is up.

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Nah, I'm starving.
I was just about to dig in. *NOM* Urph...!

Augh! Spicy! My tongue is burning! I knew it. This stuff is
way too spicy for me to eat. Come to think of it, though,
I (well, Adrienne) am teeechnically not supposed to be
feeling well, so maybe I can get away with just a few
painful bites.

DANI: Adrienne, if you're still not feeling great,
you don't have to force yourself to eat.

Praise the gods, old and new. It looks like Dani thinks
I'm still under the weather. 

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Yeah, you're right.
I probably shouldn't push it.

Hopefully I'm not making her worry too much. I'm sorry
about this, Dani. I'll just have to carry the leftovers home
with me, I guess.

I'll just have to carry the leftovers from lunch home with

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Mm, that was tasty!
Oh, hey. If you're not gonna eat that, Adrian, I will. 

*yoink* *NOM*

Apparently, Adrienne had finished her (technically my)
lunch already and was already looking for seconds. She
reached out and snatched a big red lump out of my/her
leftover (okay, almost completely untouched) lunch and
popped it in her mouth.

DANI: Huh. I thought you didn't like spicy foods, Adrian.
But sharing bites of each other's lunch IS something that
lovey-dovey couples do all the time, I guess.

What, that's it? Well, if she's not gonna sweat the small
stuff, I'm not about to waste my breath complaining.

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Yum! Man, I'm stuffed.

Huh? While my mind was wandering, my (again,
technically her) entire lunchbox was licked clean. Sheesh!
You eat way too fast, Adrienne!

☆5th Period: Language 1

TEACHER: Today, each of you will be reading a book in
the library and writing a short essay on it. Please gather
your things and move to the library.

Reading, eh? I wonder if Adrienne will do okay. Usually,
just looking at a book thicker than a magazine is enough
to put her to sleep.

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): *YAAAWN* N'kay...
C'mon, Adrian. Dani. Let's go to the library.

For the love of-- We haven't even left the classroom and
already she's yawning. Well, it IS right after lunch.
People do get sleepy after eating. And SOMEBODY had
a double portion today.

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Yeah, let's go.

If we didn't hurry, it looked like Adrienne would fall
asleep on the spot. Though if you thought about it, all we
would be doing is delaying the inevitable.

☆5th Period: Language 2

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Zzz... Zzz...

Yep. Out like a light. Is it normal for a person to fall dead
asleep the moment their butt hits the chair in a library?
Oh, but wait a sec! Since she's in my body, it looks like I'M
the one who's asleep. Shoot. I don't think the teacher has
noticed yet, but if I let this go on too long, she will
eventually.

DANI: Hm? Wow, Adrian's asleep in the library. That's
not something you see every day. Now if it was Adrienne,
nobody would be surprised. Maybe he's tired from all the
effort and stress of taking care of you after you
collapsed in gym class, Adrienne.

Uh, thanks, but I hardly ever fall asleep in class. No, nix
that. I NEVER fall asleep in class. Still, it seems like Dani
is taking it all in stride, so I guess I can let Adrienne sleep
a little longer.

It's true that today's been stressful for both of us and
part of it--no, pretty much ALL of it is entirely my fault.
I don't really have the right to deny her a little nap.

DANI: I guess we'll have to do something to make sure he
doesn't get caught, though.

Good point. For now, let's see...

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): I have an idea.
Leave it to me.

I picked up Adrienne (well, myself, technically) and moved
her into the seat directly in front of me. I figured that
would make it a little harder to notice that she was
sleeping. Would that be enough, though? Either way, I was
going to wake her up in just a few minutes, so I guess it
would have to do.

☆After School 1

*BING BONG DING DONG* 

Saved by the bell. Fifth period is over. Our teacher didn't
catch Adrienne sleeping, which is kind of a miracle, since
she wound up snoring through the whole class. I'd planned
to wake her up, but she just looked so comfortable
snoozing away that I couldn't bring myself to do it.
Besides, anyone who didn't finish writing their essay just
had to take it home and do it as homework. And it wasn't
just Adrienne, either. Almost no one could finish reading
an entire book AND write a short essay on it in a single
hour. Most of the class was taking the assignment home.
Heck, even I hadn't finished reading yet. 

Anyway, none of that is especially relevant. For now,
I need to wake Adrienne up.

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Adrienne? Wake up.
Class is over.

It was our last class of the day, too. Now we could head
straight home and do something about finding a way to
switch our bodies back.

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Mnn... *YAAAWN*
Mornin', Adrian. Is class over? Great! Let's go shopping.

Blinking, Adrienne yawned, then bounced up and started
tugging at my arm to hurry me along. Boy, she sure has a
lot of energy for someone who just woke up. Still, it's
pretty much par for the course with her. And she's right,
we did have to hurry and go-- Waaait a minute. What did
she say again?

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): Wait, what do you mean,
go shopping?

If my ears weren't playing tricks on me, she said she
wanted to go shopping.

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Aww, don't tell me you
forgot! You promised we could go shopping after school
today!

Well, yes. I do recall saying that, but I really think there
are more important things than shopping given our
present...condition.

DANI: What, you're going on a shopping date AGAIN?
Talk about a couple of lovebirds. Welp, I don't want to be
a third wheel, so I'll leave you two to it. Bye! See you
tomorrow!

With that, Dani turned and left to go home on her own.
I felt a little bad about that, but in this particular case,
she really WOULD be a third wheel. I was a little glad
she'd decided to go home by herself.

ADRIAN (In Adrienne's body): I haven't forgotten about
my promise, but don't you think we really ought to do
something about swapping back into our original bodies
first?

Adrienne smiled and nodded, my words obviously flying
over her head. She tugged on my arm while walking
backwards, not even looking where she was going. Uh-oh.
I have a feeling she's going to--

ADRIENNE (In Adrian's body): Aww, what's the matter?
We can save that for later. Let's go shopp-- OOPS!

There, see? Because she wasn't paying attention to
where she was going, she caught her heel on something
and teetered, trying hard not to fall.

Not that I could do much to stop her fall, since she
already had my arm in a vice grip. (Even if she had tried
to let go, I would've clung on tight to try and save her.)
And so both of us went tumbling to the ground.

ADRIAN & ADRIENNE: OUCH!

*BONK* 

We hit the ground, our heads bonking together hard
enough that I saw stars.

ADRIAN: Oof! Owww... Are you okay, Adri-- Huh?
Wait a sec. Something's weird.

ADRIENNE: Yeah, I'm okay. Though my skull feels like
it's splitting open... Wait. Huh? What the heck?
Why are you sitting right in front of me?

Good question. I sat on the ground, facing Adrienne as she

ADRIAN: Wait... If you're right in front of me...

I looked across from myself, staring at Adrienne.
What I saw was the body that, on any normal day,
I was used to seeing either beside or in front of me.

ADRIENNE: And you're right in front of me, so...

Adrienne scrutinized me in much the same way.

ADRIAN & ADRIENNE: We switched back?!

I looked down...and saw, after what had felt like an
eternity of displacement, the same body I'd had my whole
life. MY body. Meanwhile, Adrienne was having the same
realization.

ADRIENNE: Cool! Now that we have our bodies back,
let's go shopping!

Wow. Even after all that, all she can think about is going
shopping. Well, no use crying over spilled...bodies? Our wild
day of living in one another's shoes (literally) was at last
at an end, leaving me without any reason to decline her
enthusiastic invitation.

classmates is all around them.) You see, tomorrow is the
long-awaited Autumn Class Trip. This year, they are

careful about on our trip. Listen closely. Firstly, everyone
is to gather at the school gate by 8:00 AM tomorrow
morning. Don't be late, okay? And be sure to bring all of
your hiking supplies. Everything is written on the list
I gave you, so be sure to read it over and show it to your
parents. Don't forget anything! Finally, you may bring
snacks with you, but not more than $3 worth of them.
Got it? I'm very serious. We will check everyone's bags
before we leave and anything valued at over $3 will
be confiscated.

per person! If you bring fruit or other healthy items,
those will count as part of your lunch, not as a snack.
However, you will have to eat them together with your
lunch. You can't save them for later, because then we'll
count them as part of the snack category. And if that
puts you over $3...then we'll have to confiscate the
overage. Understand? Okay! That does it for my spiel.

The teacher opened Goldie's snack bag to reveal

GOLDIE: These cookies are all homemade. I baked them
myself! That means the only cost comes from the
ingredients. Well, my mom works at a supermarket,
and I asked her to buy the ingredients for me with her
30% employee discount. That means I get to make 30%
more cookies on top of all the ones I could normally make
with just $3 worth of ingredients. Right?

Goldie's teacher stared at her, jaw agape in shock.

with such a cunning plan!

He opened his bag for Goldie and his teacher to see.

AZUL: Everything in here is a free sample from the
supermarket. Accordingly, my snacks come to a total of
zero dollars, which is significantly less than $3. Free plus
free will always be free, after all.

Rory quickly jumps into his clothes and grabs his
backpack, dashing out the door at 7:45 AM on the dot.
At this pace, he should be able to reach the school gate
without a minute to spare. That is, assuming he doesn't
get stopped at too many crosswalks.

He runs down the sidewalk towards the first
intersection. But just as he feared, the crossing sign was
blinking, on the verge of turning red.

RORY: Drat! I won't be able to make it! I'll have to take
the roundabout way.

He swiveled on his heels and ran full tilt towards the
pedestrian bridge. It would get him across the
intersection, but a full fifteen seconds slower than if he'd
made it through the crosswalk. Another few delays like
this, and he would be late for sure!

Rory ran up to the gate, sweat dripping from his brow.

GOLDIE: Gosh, Rory. What happened? You're mega late!

SAGE: I betcha he didn't wake up 'til 7:43 and realized he
would be late, so he threw on the nearest clothes, skipped
breakfast, and dashed out of his house, only to barely miss
the crosswalk signal and hafta take the pedestrian
bridge, putting him fifteen seconds behind schedule.

EPISODE 16: THE GOLDEN AGE

RORY: All right, all right. Y'see, what I'm thinking is...

Rory pulled his wallet out of his pocket.

RORY: ...I'll use this baby right here.

GOLDIE: Hm? What about your wallet?

RORY: Simple. I can just duck into the nearest mini-mart
and use my allowance to buy more snacks.

EVERYONE: Ohhh...!

TEACHER: I'm afraid that won't work, Rory.

The teacher leaned over the back of her seat and spoke
in a matter-of-fact tone.

RORY: Huh? But why not, ma'am? There wasn't any rule
that said we weren't allowed to bring money along.
At least, I don't think there was...

Rory looked at the teacher in confusion.

TEACHER: Now, you were right when you said there
isn't any rule against bringing money. You actually had
a pretty logical idea. There's just one problem.
Never mind candy stores--we won't pass so much as
a single mini-mart the entire way to the mountain.
It isn't that you aren't allowed to buy more snacks
on the way; you CAN'T...

RORY: What...?! No! Please, ma'am, say it ain't so...!

of you kids wracked your brains on how to skirt the $3
limit on snacks, and your idea DOES make logical sense,
but it just won't work out this time.

RORY: ...

TEACHER: Ah well. Not every day can be a rousing
victory for all of snack-kind. You'll just have to make
the most of what you brought. It could be much worse,
I promise you.

But Goldie's cheerful offer wasn't enough to dispel the
dour look from Rory's face.

RORY: That isn't the problem. It's that I lost.
Our teacher DEFEATED me...

GOLDIE: Huh? How so? It just so happened that our
route to the mountain doesn't go by any mini-marts.
It was bad luck that did you in, not our teacher.

Yet Sage's words failed to move Rory, who simply sat in
his seat, frowning to himself...

RORY: Whether bad luck or strategic defeat, it's still
defeat all the same. There're no mini-marts, so I can't
buy more snacks. My plan failed... Wait, since when has
this been a contest?

What the heck IS this?!

AZUL: An Extra-Hot Spicy Pepper Bun. Well? Did it send
your energy level soaring into the stratosphere, or what?

SAGE: Dunno what it's called. I just know it's
a mushroom that gives you a lot of energy. But, uh...it has

yesterday. After raging for ten minutes or so, I felt
totally fine.

and shoulders heaving. Goldie, Sage, and Azul carefully
approach him...

I'm even MORE tired. I--

But before he could continue, Rory was interrupted
by a strange sound.

GOLDIE: Huh? What's that?

Goldie pointed. Off to the side, the earth seemed to be
rippling and cracking, as if something was emerging from
deep below.

GOLDIE: Is something trying to come out of the ground,
maybe?

AZUL: It is also conceivable that the earth is forming
itself into some sort of shape.

higher and higher. Before long, our intrepid heroes stood
in front of what appeared to be a twelve-meter-tall

on this mountain, falling in love with her at first sight.

how does the doll know her name?

RORY: Uhhh... Maybe it heard her friends call her that?
Or it could've looked it up in the phone book afterwards.

GOLDIE: Okay, even if that were somehow true, why
would it attack? Especially if it thinks we're the person
it likes. Most people don't attack the person they like.

RORY: Urk...! Good point.

(*Note: Throughout all of this deliberation, the earthen
doll is STILL squeezing Mechabot Ultror by the throat.

AZUL: If, as you propose, the earthen doll is attacking
people who hike on this mountain willy-nilly, I would
think that to be a newsworthy event. Yet I have neither
seen nor heard anything about any such incidents.
Thus, I suspect there have been no attacks beyond this
one.

SAGE: Dude, we already debunked that dumb idea

RORY: Buh? Why?

GOLDIE: Well, you DID go nuts for a bit when you
knocked down all those trees. That's why the voice was
saying "don't break the trees."

RORY: Ohhh, I get it! So it's my fault that big earthen
doll showed up in the first place?

instead of the pepper buns...

GOLDIE: If only I'd given you some more cookies instead...

The entire team voiced their support for Rory, reflecting

Our intrepid heroes apologized sincerely and in unison.
Slowly, the earthen doll let go of its grip on Mechabot
Ultror's neck. Bits of it began to fall away as it unmade
itself and returned to the earth from whence it came.

To the untrained eye, there remained no evidence that a
giant earthen doll was wreaking havoc in this spot mere
moments before.

AZUL: An interesting question. Perhaps we ought to
repair them.

RORY: How do we do that?

GOLDIE: Umm... What if we just put the broken ends
together, take some sticks to brace them, and wrap them
all up with bandages? You know, like an emergency cast.

bandage around the last tree.

EVERYONE: We're really sorry, Mother Nature.

And they all bowed in heartfelt apology.

RORY: Still... In the end, Mechabot Ultror didn't really do
much for us, did it?

SAGE: I mean, this whole kerfuffle was our fault to begin
with, so...meh.

AZUL: An astute point.

GOLDIE: But now we've apologized and made it
all better.

SAGE: Yeah. Now we can get back to enjoying our
class trip.

RORY: Right. So...let's go, guys. Let's hike like we've never
hiked before!

And so, Rory, Azul, Goldie, and Sage returned to their
hike, enjoying their snacks along the way. Eventually, they
made it to the mountain summit with high spirits and full
tummies. The laughter of children echoed across the

that would last a lifetime.

This year, like every year, all four kids' families have
scheduled a combination Christmas and birthday party.
Right now, our heroes are smack dab in the middle of
preparing for their special day.

GOLDIE: Hey, guys?

Goldie walked up and spoke to the three boys, who were
busily decorating the room. 

RORY: Hm? What is it?

(NOTE: Rory, Azul, and Sage were in charge of
decorating, while Goldie was handling food prep. She was
taking a quick break and decided to come ask the boys a

Rory turned to look outside the window. It had been crisp
and clear in the morning, but now a light snow was falling.

"That's right," Rory thought to himself. "It was exactly
one year ago, on a snowy day just like this, that it all
began..."

preparing to throw a combination Christmas/birthday
party for the four of us.

GOLDIE: Ugh. The same shenanigans, year after year.
Don't you ever get sick of it?

RORY: Sick of what?

GOLDIE: Well, all four of us were born on Christmas,
right? So we get our birthday parties and Christmas
parties all mashed together on a single day. That's just
one party! We only get presents once! Everybody else
who has different birthdays gets twice the parties and
twice the presents! How is that fair?

TO BE CONTINUED...

except we got twice the presents. But I guess life doesn't
work out that neatly, does it?

RORY: Yeah, I totally understand. Heck, I don't even
want two presents--it'd be so much cooler if we could
each get something really different, or really big,
or whatever.

AZUL: I agree.

GOLDIE: Yeah. I knew you all would feel the same.

Christmas day. Every year, the four families got together
for a party. Every year, the four friends had the same
conversation. But unbeknownst to them, this year was
going to be different--much different.

get home.

The clock had just passed 3:00 PM. The four friends'
parents weren't going to return for at least three more
hours. 

GOLDIE: Hmm... Do you wanna go outside and play?

AZUL: My intuition says it's snowing a little too hard for
us to play outdoors right now.

SAGE: Whoa, you're right!

Everyone turned to look outside the window. That's when
it happened...

AZUL: It seems doubtful that was merely the sun glinting
off of the snow.

SAGE: Then what the heck was it?

RORY: Think we should go out and see?

EVERYONE: Yeah!

The four friends bundled up and went outside. On the
horizon, they could see a strange light shining from their
school.

RORY: Wait... Is the school on fire?

AZUL: Doubtful. That light seems to be emanating from
the mountain behind the school.

RORY: Okay, guys! Let's all go check it out!

And so they took off at a dash, heading for the mountain
shining on the horizon.

light. I don't think it's a fire.

RORY: Yeah, it doesn't look like one. I wonder what it's
coming from?

SAGE: Guess we'll find out when we get there.

AZUL: Indeed. Let's hurry.

EVERYONE: Yeah.

*tromp tromp tromp*

They forged ahead, pushing through the thickly falling
snow. Before long, they arrived at the school gate.

To the mountain behind the school and ever upward, the
four moved on, the light growing brighter around them.
It seemed clear that the source of the light had to be
somewhere close by.

Goldie, who had been taking point, gestured towards
something glowing. The three boys turned to look, and...

and the boys turned to look...

GOLDIE: What's that?

AZUL: It seems...human?

Yes. It was, in fact, a humanoid being. And it was glowing.

AZUL: But no human glows like that. Could it perhaps be
an alien?

RORY: Then is it here to invade Earth and enslave
humanity?

GOLDIE: Oh gosh! Oh geez! I guess we'll have to beat it
up before that can happen and save humanity.

SAGE: My knuckles are cracked and I'm ready to attack.
You guys in?

from that glowy alien?

annihilate all living beings on this planet in less than

RORY: Whoa, they're huge! And wow, that name. Yikes.
Could you get any more generic than "Mechabot"?
Well, whatever. If we use these, we'll be able to defeat
that mystery space alien, right?

VOICE: Phlogiston's power burns and spreads by the
hour, growing ever greater. Before, these Mechabots

VOICE: However, I believe it will all work out in the end.
After all, these mecha have been powered up to account
for Phlogiston's ever-growing strength. That is why
there are four of them, in fact.

RORY: So there used to be only three or something?

VOICE: Correct. Three of these Mechabots can combine
to form the powerful combat machine Mechabot Ultror.
However, as an update to the design, a fourth Mechabot
was added. Now all four can combine to form an even
more powerful version: the Invincible Mechabot Ultror.

increased, but this new model also boasts new weaponry...

you four. Were those our only requirements, we would

GOLDIE: Then why did you...?

VOICE: Firstly, the pilots we need must be four
individuals tied by close bonds of friendship. To bring out
these Mechabots' true power, the four hearts of the
pilots must become one. Secondly, the Mechabots are
great and terrible weapons. We can only gift them to

lose yourselves to fear. You chose to approach me with

recklessness, but I believe the four of you are worthy.

appropriate pose and shout "Mechabot change," you will
transform into your Mechabot Suits. These are
absolutely necessary for piloting a Mechabot. Should you
attempt to do so without wearing one, you will suffer
immense discomfort from the feedback. So please, make
certain you only pilot your Mechabot while wearing this
special suit.

EPISODE 19: DESTROY

VOICE: Well, er...yes. But a hero must set a proper mood,
you know?

EVERYONE: ...

VOICE: Hm? Are you perhaps having difficulty coming up
with a pose? What about this one? *ba-BAM*
Or perhaps this? *schWING*

AZUL: Thank you, but we will come up with poses on our
own.

VOICE: Really? Well then, I've given you your Mechabots
and your Mechabot Suits, so my business here is done.
Combine your powers and neutralize the threat of the
mysterious space creature Phlogiston. Good day.

RORY: Hold up. What's this Floggy-ston thing again?

VOICE: ...I led with that information, if I'm not mistaken.
It's "Phlogiston." You know, the Inferno God? Burns you
to a crisp if it so much as looks at you the wrong way?

AZUL: I do not recall you mentioning the "Inferno God"
part.

VOICE: (Drat! One of them noticed.) Erm, anyway... It is
making its way towards your planet, and will arrive here
sooner or later. Good day and good luck.

GOLDIE: And that's how we ended up with our
Mechabots.

RORY: Yep.

AZUL: Still... Despite receiving our Mechabots, we have
yet to see any sign of that supposed "Inferno God."

RORY: Right?

SAGE: Heck, that one guy didn't even show up until...what,
four months after we got 'em? It was the first day of
the new school year, right?

GOLDIE: Yeah, I remember! If that glowy alien knew it
was gonna take this long, it should have told us.

*BING BONG*

GOLDIE: Oopsie! Our parents are back. I guess we really
got lost in reminiscing, huh? Let's hurry up and finish
getting everything ready for the party.

EVERYONE: Yeah! Let's!

If you throw an offering into her Spring, she will appear

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0843]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0844]
The ravages of time have left Ellen much less mobile than

who devotes herself excessively to her family's well-being
at the expense of her own.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0845]

[0855]
And his grandmother, Ellen.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0856]
A little smart-mouth, he enjoys playing pranks. However,
the residents look on his antics kindly, brushing them off
as nothing more than youthful games. Under all his boyish
bravado, he's actually a crybaby.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0857]
Join us next episode, when we introduce you to Jeff!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0858]

[0859]
His wife, Sasha.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0860]
And daughter, Karen.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0861]
His timid nature makes it easy for customers to
intimidate him into putting their purchases on a tab.
His anxiety often leaves him with ulcers. He and Duke
grew up together. To this day, the other man still
occasionally bullies him.
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0867]
Taking strongly after her mother, Karen can't turn
a blind eye to those in need. She's prone to getting
"lost in the sauce," as it were, and enjoys dancing.
Her culinary skills leave much to be desired.

Her husband, Jeff.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0871]
The polar opposite of her husband, she is brusque,
confident, and outspoken. Though she does nag Jeff
constantly, she is always there to help him. She enjoys
prying into--er, "looking after" others' affairs.

elegant, one-of-a-kind woman, and he still thinks about
her every day.

Her father, Dudley.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0881]

confidence in her value as a romantic partner. As soon as
someone broaches the subject, she tends to retreat into
her insecurities.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0882]
Join us next episode, when we introduce you to Kappa!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0883]
This is Kappa. He (it?) is a deity that lives in (presides
over?) the lake. He was born...um...on a day ending in "y."
Yeah. 

He's cuckoo for Cucumbers. Sometimes, fishers will cast
their lines in his lake and hit him on the head with their
hooks. That annoys him. Other than that, Kappa is a
complete mystery.

And her mother, Anna.
<------------------------------------------------------->

A bibliophile, Marie not only loves reading, but she is also
an author herself. An author-in-progress, anyway.
She can be quite absentminded, and has little interest
in romance.

Her husband, Basil.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0897]
Anna is a staunch proponent of the quiet and easygoing
Mineral Town lifestyle. Even so, given how devoted her
husband Basil is to his research, she does occasionally
feel a little lonely. Her hobby is baking sweets, and she's
a deft hand at it.

[0906]
His son, Harris.

[0907]
Many years ago, he lived with a tenant named Kano, but
Kano has long since moved away. Maintaining amicable
relations with all the townsfolk is something Mayor

His wife, Manna.

And daughter, Adge.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0916]
Duke has always enjoyed a good drink, but since his
daughter Adge left home for the big city, he's spent even
more time drinking than ever before. He generally acts
like an alpha male around other men, but he's spineless
before his wife, Manna.

[0923]
He originally moved to Mineral Town to proselytize, but
as the years have gone by, his priorities seem to have
shifted. Now he is enjoying a quiet and leisurely life of

curses on tools, but he laments how little use there is for
such an arcane talent.

the Beach Cafe on Mineral Beach. (Summer only).
His birthday is Summer <string0>.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0927]
Kai comes to Mineral Town from the big city every
summer. Though exceptionally charismatic to some, his

Mineral Town!

First is Kano, a photographer who once lived in town
with Mayor Thomas. He came to Mineral Town so that
he could take beautiful pictures of people living in
harmony with nature. His birthday is Winter 2.

Next is Chu, an entomologist who came to Mineral Town
to perform research on his thesis about bees.
His birthday is Spring 2.

And finally there's Greg, an avid angler. He has since
moved away, but he left his old Fishing Rod behind for
an up-and-coming fisher. His birthday is Spring 29.

and absorb its natural energies.

New Year's Calligraphy

"Happy New Year, everyone. As today is Spring 1, the
first day of the new year, we would like to ask all of our
guests to write a new year's proverb in calligraphy.
Everyone, if you please..."

*skirch skirch skirch skirch skirch*

"Now, the first step in traditional calligraphy is to wet
the inkstone and grind some ink."

*blup blup blup blup blup blup*

"Though we DO have some people taking the modern
route by using liquid ink."

..............

"All right, now that everyone has made their ink
(or succumbed to the temptation of modern convenience),
let us move on to the drawing step. I wonder what
proverb everyone will choose."

*scribble scribble scribble* *tunk*

"Aha. It seems everyone has finished. Now, let's see
what they have drawn. I think we will start with Ms. A.
What proverb did she choose?"
[FIRST SUNRISE]
"My, now there is a phrase that perfectly encapsulates
the new year! Moving on, let's see what Mr. B wrote."
[NEW YEAR'S PROVERB]
"Somebody certainly cut to the heart of the assignment!
What about you, Mr. C?"
[NEW YEAR'S ALLOWANCE]
"Pragmatic. I presume you didn't get much of one, did
you? And now for our last guest, Ms. D. What have you
written for us?"
[HAPPY NEW YEAR]
"And a Happy New Year to you, too!"

"Well, then. I would say that everyone selected unique
and appropriate new year's proverbs to reflect their
personalities. Thank you for joining us, and I hope to see
you next year."<wait>

are crisscrossing back and forth! Unbelievable!"

A Frying Pan

The Reading Maiden

Every day at the same time, in the same spot by the train
car door, she's there. As the train pulls away, she places
her bag by her feet and removes a paperback novel
neatly wrapped in a slipcover. She opens it to the leaf she
uses for a bookmark and begins to read.

The train arrives at the next station. The door she was
leaning on opens, and she wobbles for a moment. The leaf
slips from its spot in her book and flutters towards the
floor. She hurriedly tries to catch it, but it slips between
her fingers and flits to the ground. She snatches it up and
carefully brushes off the dirt, delicately placing it back in
its spot between the last pages of the book. The train
begins to move again, and she resumes reading once more.

The next stop is hers. She takes the leaf and sets it on
the last page she read, gently closing the book around it.
Bending over, she slips the book back into the bag at her
feet and, tossing the bag's strap over her shoulder, stands
up. The train slows to a halt, and she turns to face the
door. It opens, and she walks out into the world beyond.<wait>

The Twin Maidens

Every day at the same time, in the same spot by the train
car door, she's there.
Standing alone, she leans against the door, her eyes
closed. She waits for the next stop--the stop where her
friend always boards.

The train slows to a stop. She opens her eyes and slowly
turns to face the door, a smile creeping up the corners of
her lips. There, on the platform, she sees her friend
waiting. The door opens. Her friend trots up to her and
sweeps her up in a hug. Eyes bright, they begin chatting
about the next week's final exams.

The next stop is theirs. Somehow, their conversation topic
shifted from tests to their least favorite teachers. The
train slows to a halt, and the doors open. Still gossiping,
eyes still bright with exuberance, the two girls clasp
hands and step out into the world beyond.<wait>

The Gazing Maiden

Every day at the same time, in the same seat in the same
train car, she's there. She sits with her head turned over
her shoulder, her eyes watching the scenery pass outside
the window. With her face turned away, there is no way
to observe her expression. But when the train zips into a
tunnel, the reflection on the window shares her secret
with the far side of the car. Her countenance is blank.

The train slows, pulling into the next station. Her body
bobs slightly as it comes to a halt. New passengers step
on, and one sits next to her. For a moment, she turns her
eyes from the window to look at who it is, but then she
returns her gaze to the outside. Once again, the train
begins to move, the scenery outside whizzing by while the
look on her face remains unchanged.

The next stop is hers. As the train slows, she stands up
and moves in front of the door. Her eyes, of course, stay
fixed on a point beyond the glass, and her face remains as
neutral as ever. The doors open, and she steps out into
the world beyond.<wait>

The Sleeping Maiden

Every day at the same time, in the same seat in the same
train car, she's there. She sits, chin slumped to her chest,
dozing lightly. Her body wobbles back and forth with the
rocking of the train. Rounding a turn, the train gives a
hard jolt, snapping her head back to bonk against the
window. Letting out a grunt of pain and surprise, she
wakes and quickly hunches over, clutching at the back of
her head. She stays that way for the briefest moment,
the glint of a tear in her eye and a low hiss escaping her
lips. Not long after, she straightens back up, the pain
already fading into memory. Settling back down, she
closes her eyes and allows sleep to claim her once again.

The train pulls into the next station, slowing to a halt.
She opens her eyes a crack and glances out the window.
Seeing it isn't her stop, her eyes drift closed and she goes
back to sleep.

The next stop is hers. The train slows to a halt and the
doors open, but she shows no sign of waking.<wait>

Every day at the same time, in the same seat in the same
train car, she's there. She sits, chin slumped to her chest,
dozing lightly. The train halts at her station and the door
opens, but she shows no sign of waking. The doors slide
closed and the train once again begins to move. She still
does not wake.

Some time later, her eyes flutter open. For a moment, she
stares dazedly ahead, but then her head snaps up and she
looks around wildly. Realization sinks in and she slumps
over, head cradled in her hands. She heaves a sigh, stands,
and shuffles over to the car door, the look on her face
making her familiarity with this situation all too clear.

The train pulls into the next station, slowing to a halt.
As the door opens, she dashes out and runs across the
platform to the other side, hoping to catch the next train
heading in the other direction. The scrolling signs hanging
above the track imply that she has a long wait ahead.<wait>

The Snacking Maiden

Every day at the same time, in the same seat in the same
train car, she's there. As ever, she sits with her bag at
her feet, food in one hand and a drink in the other.
Did she not have the time to enjoy a leisurely breakfast
at home? Today, she holds an egg sandwich in her left
hand and a box of 100% apple juice in her right. A plastic
container with another slice of egg sandwich sits
balanced upon her knees. She takes a bite of her
sandwich, chewing it thoroughly before swallowing.
Next, she raises the juice box to her lips and takes
a big sip.

Back and forth she goes until the sandwich is eaten
and the last swallow of juice is making its way down
her throat. She crushes the juice box, tossing it into
the plastic box that once held the sandwich. With one
hand, she grabs her bag, steadying herself with the
other, and stands, making her way to the train door.

It just so happens that the train is pulling into her stop.
The doors open and she briskly steps out, making a detour
to her right to toss her trash into the trash can. Dusting
off her hands, she walks off into the world beyond.<wait>

The Stumbling Maiden

The train sits quietly, its engine purring, waiting its final
minute at the station. It's nearly time for it to depart.
It is also nearly the time she is supposed to arrive.
Will today be the day she makes it in time?

The bell rings. It's time to depart. Footsteps come
pounding up the stairs to the platform. Is it her? It is. She
reaches the top step and, in her haste, catches her toe on
its lip. She goes stumbling forward, her knee banging into
the ground. She staggers to her feet, one hand rubbing
her bruised knee. The train doors close. For a moment,
she stares uncomprehendingly at the doors, the pain in
her knee forgotten. The train begins to leave, and she is
not on it.

Once again she is left to stand on the platform, waiting
and waiting for the next train to arrive.<wait>

The Bumping Maiden

Every day at the same time, in the same seat in the same
train car, she's there. She sits with her bag at her feet,
a large case for a racket of some kind--perhaps a tennis
racket?--held carefully in her arms.

The train pulls to a halt at the next stop, and new
passengers get on. One tries to pass her and winds up
bumping into her racket, which is so large it protrudes
out into the aisle. Panicking, she quickly stands and bows,
apologies tumbling from her lips. Not that the passenger
seems terribly bothered by the incident. Still, she
continues her apology, even as the train lurches into
motion. Caught in an awkward position, the sudden motion
throws her off balance, and she stumbles forward right
into the passenger. Her face turns bright red, and her
apologies begin anew. The passenger, not perturbed in the
slightest, settles into the seat next to her.<wait>

The next stop is hers. She gathers her things and stands
to leave, but as she rises, the handle of her racket bonks
her seat neighbor in the chin. Panicking, she quickly turns
and bows in a show of deference, apologies tumbling from
her lips. Not that the passenger seems terribly bothered
by the incident. Still, she continues to bow and apologize,
even as the train lurches to a halt. Caught in an
awkward position, the sudden stop throws her off
balance, and she topples right into the passenger. Her
face turns bright red, prompting her to begin apologizing
once more from the top. The passenger, not perturbed in
the slightest, mentions that the train doors are closing.
Her eyes widen, and she bows apologetically one last time
before dashing out the door. Even outside, she comes
around to the window and begins relaying how sorry she
is. And so she continues as the doors close and the train
pulls out of the station.<wait>

The Staring Maiden

Every day at the same time, in the same seat in the same
train car, she's there. Her eyes stare ahead, fixed on one
spot...on one person sitting in the next car over. She never
goes to talk to them, she never moves to see them. She
simply sits and stares.

Occasionally, the person in the other car turns to look
her way, but she promptly redirects her gaze. Only once
that person turns away does she resume her silent vigil.
Why? If she wants to watch them, why not sit in the
same car? Perhaps she has her reasons.

The next stop is hers. Slowly, reluctantly, she stands and
walks out the doors, her eyes lingering on the other car.
Even after she steps out and the doors close, her eyes
gaze steadily at the object of her fixation as the train
pulls away and out of sight.<wait>

MS. AYAME: Hmm. A good question. Well, since they
were kind enough to send you a warning, why not make
a game of it?

SAKURA: Oh yeah! Now that I think about it, Granny
used to play games of cat-and-mouse with a phantom
thief in her youth. I guess this means I get to make my
debut as a lovely detective now!

MS. AYAMA: What? Sakura, don't tell me that your
grandmother was the famous detective, Lady Yamabuki
Haruhi!

Ms. Ayame. Do you want me to get her autograph for
you?

MS. AYAME: Ooh, really? Would you do that for me?
I'd love to frame it and put it on my desk.

SAKURA: Okie-dokie, I'll get it for you. Oh, and by the
way, should I really turn this bread business into a cat-
and-mouse game?

MS. AYAME: Of course! I think it would be wonderful
fun. I would be glad to assist you with it, too. Now then,
let's go to your desk. It won't be so easy for Star Lily to
steal your snack if we both keep an eye on it.

MS. AYAME: This is, what, six calling cards now?
Do you mind if I read it?

Summary－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Unbelievable! Yet another letter was delivered to
Sakura's house.

MS. AYAME: Now, then... *rustle rustle* Let's see here.
It reads: "I'm terribly sorry for my continued mistakes.
This time, I helped myself to the leftover bread in your
desk at 7 o'clock in the morning. It seems I neglected to
mention whether I meant AM or PM in my calling card.
I will make certain to include that information in my
future calling cards. Mysteriously Yours, Star Lily,
Heart Snatcher."

Aha, she's correct. She DID omit the AM in her latest
calling card. Hopefully she will finally get it right next
time.

LOVELY DETECTIVE SAKURA: Not that we know
whether there will even BE a next time.

MS. AYAME: Tut tut, Sakura. No running in the halls,
please.

LOVELY DETECTIVE SAKURA: Oopsie! I'm sorry,
Ms. Ayame.

MS. AYAME: Now, what is it, Sakura?

LOVELY DETECTIVE SAKURA: Ms. Ayame, look.
This was delivered to my house this morning.

And the XXth is tomorrow.

LOVELY DETECTIVE SAKURA: Yes, it is. Tomorrow,
we will finally have our showdown!

The next day...

MS. AYAME: Well, it's 7:00 PM.

MS. AYAME: Wait a moment. Is that you, Himeyuri?

LOVELY DETECTIVE SAKURA: Huh? Himeyuri? As in,
my classmate Himeyuri?

Star Lily, Heart Snatcher: Wha--?! Blast! How have you
pierced the veil of my impeccable disguise?!

MS. AYAME: Goodness me, is it really that hard for you
to tell? Her voice is giveaway enough. And that "clever
disguise" is nothing but a simple mask. What other petite
girl with orange hair do you know of at this school?
It simply must be Himeyuri.

HIMEYURI: MWAH HA HA HA! Well done, Ms. Ayame!
I commend you on your clever deduction. However, I shall
still help myself to the leftover bread in that desk!

LOVELY DETECTIVE SAKURA: Not so fast, Star Lily,
Heart Snatcher! I've laid a special trap in that desk!
Prepare to be ensnared!

HIMEYURI: MWAH HA HA HA HA! A trap? Could you
be referring to...THIS?

MS. AYAME: Hm? Is that a bread wrapper?

HIMEYURI: When I snuck by earlier today to case your
desk, I saw this on your chair. As it was simply sitting
there all by its lonesome, I helped myself to it.

LOVELY DETECTIVE SAKURA: Aww. And here
I thought that if there were two snack breads,
you would be caught in analysis paralysis as you
struggled to figure out which one you were
supposed to take.

MS. AYAME: If there were two of them, she could take
either and it would still count as stealing your leftover
bread, thereby fulfilling the heist outlined on her calling
card. Though...wait a moment. Why are you always after
leftover snack bread, Himeyuri? And why only from
Sakura?

clever Ms. Ayame hasn't figured out the entirety of my
grand plan. Well then, as a reward for uncovering my
true identity, I shall tell you. Come, Agapanthus!

AGAPANTHUS: Yip yip!

LOVELY DETECTIVE SAKURA: Oh my gosh, what
a cute puppy!

MS. AYAME: Erm. I'm afraid dogs aren't really my thing...
But why on earth do you have one?

HIMEYURI: Well, you see, back on the OXth, I found her
abandoned at the school gate. I wanted to give her
something to eat, but I didn't have anything on me. That's
when I remembered seeing Sakura put her leftover snack
bread in her desk after lunch...

their bread at lunch, but the only one who left it at
school was Sakura...

LOVELY DETECTIVE SAKURA: Aha, I see. And it was
for that noble cause that Star Lily, Heart Snatcher was
born...

MS. AYAME: Why go through the trouble of becoming a
phantom thief? If you'd only mentioned it in class, I'm sure
everyone would have helped you.

HIMEYURI: Yeah, I know. It's just, well...being a phantom
thief seemed pretty cool, y'know? Almost Robin Hood-
esque. But those days are behind me now. With Star Lily,
Heart Snatcher's true identity revealed to the world, she
can no longer operate in the shadows...

I assume I would only be an unwelcome third wheel?

LOVELY DETECTIVE SAKURA: No, Ms. Ayame. I want
you here to witness the events that are about to unfold.

HIMEYURI: Yeah. I'd like you to be here too, Ms. Ayame.

MS. AYAME: ...All right. I shall bear witness to your

HIMEYURI: Yaaay!

LOVELY DETECTIVE SAKURA: Yeah. All's well that
ends well, huh?

HIMEYURI: Right you are.

CLASSMATES: Never mind that! How did it end? Who
won the climactic final battle: Star Lily, Heart Snatcher

☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

Until now, it was believed that digging in the Spring Mine
would only yield money or Black Grass, but we are
starting to hear reports of various other finds. One of
note is the Power Berry. I have looked into the matter
and I can confirm that yes, you can indeed find Power
Berries in the Spring Mine on the 100th floor.

Another fascinating find is the Tomatosetta Stone.
I can say with certainty that you will find these in the
Spring Mine, but they lie so deep underground that
I have yet to pinpoint the exact floor. I will update you
with the details as I learn them.

See you next week.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

Everyone is aware that when you break the rocks
in the Spring Mine, you may find the following:
- Scrap Ore
- Copper
- Silver
- Gold
- Mithril
- Orichalcum
- Adamantite

Each appears with a varying degree of probability.
However, we have discovered that there are two more,
much rarer ores that you may find: Teleport Stones and
Goddess Jewels. Now, these rare ores can be found on--
hm? Ah. It looks like our time is up for today. I will go into
more detail on the next episode. 

See you next week.<wait>

☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

Continuing on from last week's report, we have
discovered that by breaking the rocks in the Spring Mine,
there is a slim chance you may discover the rare
Teleport Stone and Goddess Jewels. My experience tells
me that the Teleport Stone is likely on the bottommost
floors. 

The Goddess Jewels, however, are much harder to pin
down. I have yet to pinpoint the locations of all of them,
but I can tell you of two spots where we have confirmed
sightings: Floor 102 and Floor 202. I will update you with
the details as I learn them.

See you next week.<wait>

☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

After extensive research, we have confirmed that digging
in the Lake Mine can occasionally yield a Power Berry.
It is most likely to be found on the 19th floor.

Switching gears, we have word that one of the rumored
"cursed tools" has been discovered in the Lake Mine. The
Cursed Hoe was spotted on the 39th floor. I will update
you with more details as I learn them.

See you next week.<wait>

☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

It is common knowledge that breaking rocks in the
Lake Mine will yield any of the following:
- Amethyst
- Agate
- Fluorite
- Peridot
- Topaz
- Ruby
- Sandrose
- Moonstone
- Emerald
- Diamond

Those last two are comparatively rare, while the rest
can be found with some consistency. However, we have
learned that there are other, even rarer ores that can
be found by breaking those stones. They are--hm?
Ah. It looks like our time is up for today. I will go into
more detail on the next episode.

See you next week.<wait>

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

To continue on from last week's report, we have
confirmed that there are at least two more rare ores
that can be found by breaking rocks inside the Lake
Mine: Alexandrite and Pink Diamonds. There have been
reports of Alexandrite sighted on the 50th, 100th, and
150th floors. Meanwhile, Pink Diamonds have been
confirmed on the 30th, 110th, and 190th floors. Mind you
that these confirmed sightings don't rule out the
possibility that they exist on other floors as well. I will
update you with any more details as I learn them.

See you next week.<wait>

☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

In some fascinating news, we have word that one of the
rumored cursed tools has been discovered in the Lake
Mine. The Cursed Watering Can was spotted on the 69th
floor.

Shifting gears, we have also gotten word of a new,
exceptionally rare find in the Lake Mine. It seems that
breaking rocks has a slim chance of revealing a Kappa
Jewel. This highly prized ore was reportedly found on the
120th floor, but we have no details beyond that. I will
update you with any more information as it comes to
light.

See you next week.<wait>

[1152]
☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

In recent weeks, a rumor has been going around stating
that charging your tools to various levels before using
them in the mines will yield particular ores more
frequently. I can tell you with complete certainty that
this rumor is false. Please do not fall for it and waste
your precious Stamina.

On another note, we've received word that Alexandrite
has been found in the Lake Mine. The report states it
was discovered on the 210th floor. If anyone can
corroborate this claim, please let us know.

See you next week.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1153]
☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

A rumor that has been floating around lately says that
the mines are exactly 255 floors deep. I am doing my best
to confirm whether this is true, but even I have only made
it that far down a handful of times. It is too soon for me
to make any definitive statements. However, I CAN say
that, as of yet, no means of going lower than Floor 255
has been found. So for the moment, this particular rumor
is not beyond the realm of plausibility.

In other news, we have word that Kappa Jewels have
been discovered in the Lake Mine. The report says one
was unearthed on the 60th floor. If anyone has any
further information on this, please let us know.

See you next week.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1154]
☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

A popular rumor of late says that it's possible to visit the
Lake Mine in seasons other than winter. Not to put too
fine a point on it--yes, it IS possible. In fact, it's not just
possible; it's simple. All one must do is equip a Teleport
Stone and set their destination to the Lake Mine. The
difficult part is acquiring a Teleport Stone in the first
place.

I have tested this theory with a Teleport Stone myself,
and I can say with certainty that it functions as
expected. However, in exploring the mine throughout the
other three seasons, I have yet to find any noticeable
differences from its winter layout. I will update you with
any more details as I learn them.

See you next week.<wait>

[1155]
☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

Let us begin today with a few reports. First, a Goddess
Jewel has been found in the Spring Mine. It was located
on the 152nd floor.

Second is another report of a Goddess Jewel. This one
was discovered down on the 190th floor.

In less benevolent news, we have a confirmed sighting of
the Cursed Sickle. It was seen on the 79th floor of the
Lake Mine.

And that is all we have for today. If anyone has any new
information or discoveries to share, please let us know.

See you next week.<wait>

☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

Word on the street is that after you dig a spot in the
mines, you can plant the seeds of any crop you like--in any
season you like--and it will grow.  This is absolutely
FALSE. Please do not fall for this rumor and waste your
precious seeds.

In other news, we have word of Pink Diamonds sighted in
the Lake Mine. The report we received says they were
on the 90th floor.

And that is all we have for today. If anyone has any new
information or discoveries to share, please let us know.

See you next week.<wait>

☆Professor Ore

Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Karin, also known as Professor
Ore. Today, I'd like to share with you some things I've
learned about the mines, as well as some interesting
rumors I've heard.

Ladies and gentlemen, I have something astounding to
share today. The other day, while exploring the 222nd
floor of the Spring Mine, I broke some rocks and found an
ore so rare that almost no one has laid eyes on it before:
a Mythic Ore. As much as of a mining enthusiast as I am,
even I have never seen a true Mythic Ore until now,
so I can't say for certain what exactly led to its sudden
appearance. If anyone knows anything about
Mythic Ore--no, about anything new in the mines
whatsoever, please let us know.

See you next week.<wait>
