[0000]
Hey. So, uh, have you heard anything from your dad
lately?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0001]
Nope. Not a word. Not only did he up and leave Mom
when she's so sick, he hasn't checked in even once.
What a jerk, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0002]
Talk about selfish, just up and leaving
Mom when she's so sick!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0003]
Whoa, maybe retract those fangs a little, bud. He DID
leave because he's looking for a cure for your mom, right?<wait><page>
I don't think that's something a person would do unless
they really cared about their family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0004]
Well...yeah. Okay. Maybe.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0005]
And since he's not here, you've gotta step up and take
care of both your mom and Popuri. Got it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0006]
Well, duh. Of course I know that!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0007]
Good! On that note, what say we head home?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0008]
Yeah. And, um... Thanks, Karen.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0009]
Man, we sure played together a lot when we were kids.
Do you remember, Karen?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0010]
Yup. We came up with all kinds of games to play.
Kick the Can, Hide-and-Seek, Tag...
You name it, we played it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0011]
Haha! Yep! Heck, we even wrestled for a while, too.<wait><page>
Don't think I ever beat you, either. You taught me at a
very young age exactly what a mouthful of dirt tastes
like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0012]
H-Hey, I call shenanigans! I mean, it's not as if I was
stomping around town like some muscle-bound freak.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0013]
Uh, yes you were? I clearly remember you flinging me
around like a sack of turnips until I ran home crying.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0014]
Lies and slander! I don't remember ANY of that. Nope!
Not at all! You're making it up just to mess with me,
aren't you?<wait><page>
That does it. I'm leaving!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0015]
Huh? What are you so mad for? Um, Karen?
Kaaaren...! Come back!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0016]
Mmm, that was so yummy!<wait><page>
Boy, Kai, everything you serve at your Cafe is so new and
interesting! We don't have anything like it here in town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0017]
How do you know so much about so many different
places?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0018]
Dude, whaaat? Do I really seem like that much
of a know-it-all?<wait><page>
Haha! I mean, I travel a lot, so I pick up some stuff here
and there, but there's still tons I don't know.<wait><page>
That's why whenever I find a new dish or ingredient,
I get my butt into the kitchen and run a little taste test.<wait><page>
Not only do I like learning new stuff, but I wanna keep
updating my menu with fresh and exotic dishes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0019]
Wooow, really? That's so neat! You sure have a cool and
mature way of thinking about stuff, Kai.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0020]
Naaah, I'm not all that. Y'see, just between you and me...<wait><page>
I can't stand the cold. Like, seriously. That's why when it
starts getting chilly here, I take off for somewhere
warmer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0021]
Avoiding the chill was the main reason I first started
moving from place to place like I do. Kind of a dumb
reason, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0022]
Hee hee! Kai, you're so silly!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0023]
Hey, Kai, I wonder... Do you think that if Mom had some of
your cooking, she would feel better and happier?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0024]
I dunno! Wanna try it out? I can drop by your place and
whip something up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0025]
Ooh, will you really?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0026]
Yep, you bet! Just leave it to me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0027]
Wow! Thanks so much, Kai!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0028]
Kai is really super-duper nice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0029]
Okay, what would be best, I wonder...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0030]
I'm real glad your mom liked my cooking, Popuri.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0031]
Me too. Thanks so much for coming over and doing that,
just like you said you would. It made me so happy!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0032]
No prob! Let's just hope it puts some pep
in your mom's step.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0033]
Yeah!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0034]
Still...I'm really glad Rick wasn't home when you
came over.<wait><page>
If he found you here, I just know he'd be super-duper
upset.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0035]
Good point.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0036]
Popuri! There you are!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0037]
What are you doing here, of all places? Kai, do me a favor
and stop dragging my sister halfway across town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0038]
Hey! Don't be rude! I was just talking with him.
Is that a crime all of a sudden?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0039]
Anyway! You're supposed to be back at the store
helping me. Let's go.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0040]
Hmph! If you're so worried about the store, you can take
care of it all by yourself!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0041]
Wha-- Popuri, how could you say that?!<wait><page>
This is YOUR fault, Kai. You're the one putting ideas in
my sister's head. Knock it off!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0042]
Stop saying mean things about Kai! You don't get
anything, Rick! You're being a horrible jerk!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0043]
Sis, why can't you--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0044]
Popuri, you should probably get going. Your mom's gonna
worry, y'know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0045]
Huh? Awww! But I...
Okay. I guess you're right, Kai.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0046]
Let's go, Popuri. Kai, you stay away from my sister.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0047]
I'm sorry about this, Kai. I'll see you later, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0048]
Sure. Get home safe, 'kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0049]
Dang, you heard all that? Sorry you had to sit through...
whatever that was.<wait><page>
Rick can be pretty annoying, eh? If he ever catches me
chatting with Popuri, he comes charging up, mad as a bull.
Ugh.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0050]
Oh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0051]
Hey there, Cliff.
How do you like it here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0052]
Hey...
Uh... No complaints.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0053]
Oh, that's good to hear!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0054]
Now that I think of it, we don't talk very often, do we?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0055]
I...guess we don't.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0056]
So, why'd you come to this town?
To sightsee? Or for work? Ooh, or maybe--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0057]
Sorry, I...
I don't wanna talk about it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0058]
Oh... S-Sorry.
I shouldn't have pried. Bad habit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0059]
If you ever have a problem or need help with something,
just let me know, okay?<wait><page>
Well, I've still got work to do.
Bye!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0060]
Oh... Um...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0061]
Yeees?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0062]
I, uh...
Thanks, Ran.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0063]
You betcha!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0064]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0065]
Cliff, you ought to try speaking with the townspeople
more. They are all very nice people, I assure you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0066]
Yeah, but... It's awkward. And no one seems to actually
enjoy talking with me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0067]
You don't say? That's odd.
You speak normally with me, and I enjoy our
conversations well enough.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0068]
Because you're not like other people. Normal people,
they... It's like...they perceive me differently,
or something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0069]
What is it that makes me "not like other people,"
I wonder...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0070]
Hello, Carter!
Oh, and Cliff's with you too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0071]
Hello, Ran.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0072]
...Hey.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0073]
You are something of a rare sight around the Church,
Ran.<wait><page>
What brings you here this afternoon?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0074]
Uh, you DID order delivery, didn't you? Otherwise,
I'm here with somebody else's lunch.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0075]
Oh! I had completely forgotten.
You are absolutely right.
Thank you very much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0076]
Huh, you're more of a space case than I thought, Carter.<wait><page>
Well, here you are.
Our special lunch, just for you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0077]
By the way, what're YOU doing here at the Church,
Cliff? Praying? Confessing? CLEANING?! I have this
great wax--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0078]
Uh... Oh...
Nothing, really.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0079]
Good grief.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0080]
Ran, I have a request for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0081]
Huh? What is it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0082]
It's about Cliff. He is extremely shy, so he finds it difficult
to speak with the townspeople.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0083]
W-Wait, Carter. What're you...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0084]
I want to help you learn to get along with the
townspeople, so I'm calling in some conversational muscle,
as it were.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0085]
He's got a terminal case of shyness, huh? So THAT'S
why...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0086]
Okay, I'll do it! I'll be his partner-in-cri--er, conversation!
Just leave it to me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0087]
What?!
I-I didn't agree to--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0088]
Don't you worry! I'll rid you of that fear of strangers
faster than I can scrub a stubborn stain outta linens!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0089]
All right, I still have some work to do at the Inn,
so I'm heading back.<wait><page>
Goodbye, Carter.
See you at the Inn, Cliff.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0090]
Yes, of course.
Goodbye, Ran.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0091]
...Right.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0092]
Carter...
Why would you do that to me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0093]
Rest easy, my child.
Ran will be the perfect partner.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0094]
Something I can help you with, Marie?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0095]
The tool you repaired for me is so very easy
to use, I wanted to come thank you again
for your craftsmanship.<wait><page>
I appreciate it very much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0096]
Well, if you're that pleased by it, then I'm glad
I repaired it for you.<wait><page>
If you ever need my expertise again, come straight on
over and see me, all right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0097]
Yes! Thank you so much!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0098]
Ow!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0099]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0100]
...Don't mind me. It's nothing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0101]
Oh no, you're bleeding.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0102]
Idiot. It's because you lost focus.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0103]
I said I'm fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0104]
No, you aren't!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0105]
Wait just a second. Um...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0106]
Oh, there it is.
Give me your hand, Gray.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0107]
That should do it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0108]
Th-Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0109]
Oh, no, it's my pleasure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0110]
All right, I'll be going now. I hope to see you two
at the Library someday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0111]
We'll be sure to drop by sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0112]
I promise to visit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0113]
I'm glad. Goodbye for now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0114]
Marie sure is nice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0115]
Ugh... How many times have I told that boy to keep his
eyes on his work?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0116]
Oh, hello there, Gray.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0117]
Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0118]
Not many people in this town read books, so I hardly
get any visitors. Thank you for stopping by.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0119]
Wonder why that is? It's not like you're hurting
for interesting books here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0120]
I'm glad to hear you think so.
Oh, that's right...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0121]
To be honest, I'm writing a novel right now.
Just as a hobby, mind you. But I haven't had
many people read through it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0122]
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother, would you mind
reading it and telling me what you think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0123]
YOU'RE writing a book?
That's...that's amazing!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0124]
It's nothing that impressive, really.
So, will you help me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0125]
'Course. If you're all right with me reading it,
I'd love to help.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0126]
Wonderful. I'll bring it to you later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0127]
Right.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0128]
It's a little embarrassing to show it to other people,
but I do think I need feedback if I want to refine it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0129]
A novel written by you, huh?
Wow. I can't wait to read it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0130]
*sigh*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0131]
Are you fatigued?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0132]
No, I'm fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0133]
Please don't overwork yourself. If you were to collapse,
there would be no shortage of townspeople in distress.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0134]
Oh, Doctor...
Are you worried about me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0135]
Naturally. No good physician would be pleased to see an
increase in sick patients due to his staff's negligence.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0136]
*sigh* Oh, is that all?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0137]
What's the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0138]
No, it's nothing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0139]
Hm? Well, if you say so.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0140]
Is Elly truly all right? She seems more enervated
than ever.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0141]
*sigh*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0142]
Grandma, how are you feeling?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0143]
Oh, much better now, dear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0144]
Thank goodness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0145]
It seems it was just a cold.
Please keep warm and get plenty of rest.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0146]
Thank you, Doctor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0147]
No thanks necessary. More importantly, how are your
legs doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0148]
Hm... About the same as always, I'd say.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0149]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0150]
I apologize.
If I were only more skilled...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0151]
You've nothing to trouble yourself over, Doctor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0152]
Yes, she's right. You've already gone above and beyond
for my grandmother!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0153]
I...appreciate that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0154]
Doctor, it's about time to get back to the Clinic.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0155]
Right.
Well then, take care.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0156]
Thank you, Doctor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0157]
The word "grateful" hardly captures how I feel.
Elly and Doctor have been so good to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0158]
I really look up to Doctor!
And I'm sure Elly does, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
