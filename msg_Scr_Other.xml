You will spend the rest of today doing just that.

Oh, <playername>. Hello, sweetie. I'm afraid I'm not

We've had to close the store so I can rest. I'm terribly
sorry for the inconvenience.<wait>

Goodness, Rick. What ever is the matter? You're all out
of breath.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0225]
You were just so pale, Mom, that I ran over to the Clinic
and brought some medicine back for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0226]
Oh, you did? How sweet of you! Thank you, Rick.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0227]
*pant* *pant* *pant* Mamaaaaa! I got medicine!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0228]
What, you went out to buy medicine too?
<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0229]
"Too"? So you mean you also went out and got medicine?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0230]
No, no, sweetie. It's all right. I'm so happy you two cared
so much about me that you both got medicine.<wait><page>
I'll take both of them and get better extra fast!<wait>

Mom has never had the best health. Popuri and I do our

I hope we can find a way to cure Mom's condition soon.<wait>

Mama's always so sick. I worry a lot about her.<wait>

Aww. I guess we have an extra one we don't need, then.
I'm sorry, Mama. I wasted our money...<wait>

Rick and Popuri are such sweet children. I'm so proud of
them. I have to hurry and get better for their sakes.<wait>

*giggle* Oh yes, I am. Very much so. Today has really
raised my spirits. Can you guess why?<wait>

[0244]
Well, you see...<wait><page>
I received a letter from my husband today! It's the first
one I've ever gotten from him. I'm sooooo happy!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0245]
You're curious about what it says, aren't you?
I'll go ahead and read it for you.<wait>

Ahem.<wait><page>
"Dear Lillia. How are Rick and Popuri? I'm fine.<wait><page>
Right now, I'm searching through the desert to find the
flower that can heal your condition.<wait><page>
Finding one small flower in this huge desert will be hard,
but I do this for you. I'm sure I'll find it some day.<wait><page>
Until then, please wait for me. Take care of the store
until I return."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0247]
Oh, isn't my husband just so caring and wonderful?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0248]
Hmph. "Take care of the store," he says. Like it's
that easy. We're caring for a whole bunch of animals,
you know!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0249]
Geez, Rick. Can't you just admit you're happy to hear
from him?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0250]
If he could send a letter, that means he's safe and okay,
right? Oh, that makes me feel so much better!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0251]
I'd rather he just come home and tell us HIMSELF
instead of writing a letter.<wait>

You know what this is about. It's been a long time coming,
but--KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY SISTER!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0256]
Huh? What the heck are you on about?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0257]
Don't try to deny it! I know she comes here all the time
to see you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0258]
Dude, I haven't done anything. Popuri comes here because
she wants to.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0259]
No way! I just know you've got to be tricking her into
coming here!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0260]
Why the heck would I do that? Nothing like that is going
on at all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Geez. I feel sorry for Popuri if she's stuck with such a
blockhead for a brother.<wait>

WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?!<wait><page>
Don't you ever go anywhere near my sister again or else!
Got it?!<wait>

Sorry, dude. Can't promise you that. Even if I don't go see
her, don'tcha think she'll still come and see me?<wait>

Hi, Mr. Zack. Hi, <playername>. I didn't know you'd

Hi, Mr. Zack. Hi, <nickname>. I didn't know you'd

Mr. Zack, is my delivery here yet?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0302]
Yep! Sure is! This is it right here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0303]
Ah! Great!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0304]
Took a lotta work t'get this, y'know. Hope it turns out
good for ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0305]
Thanks! Oh, and don't tell Mama, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0306]
You betcha. I can already see the happy look on her face
when she gets a load of that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0307]
Me too. I can't wait!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0308]
Hm? You're surprised to see me here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0309]
Well, yeah. We usually have Mr. Zack deliver our orders
to the store, but I wanted to keep this one a secret.<wait><page>
That's why I asked him to hold this one here instead.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0310]
What did I buy? Um... Do you promise not to tell anyone?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0311]
What did I buy? Um... Do you promise not to tell anyone?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0312]
My lips are sealed.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0313]
No promises.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0314]
Really? You won't tell aaaaanybody? Well, all right, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0315]
See, um, Mama's birthday is coming up. I wanna surprise
her, but if I buy a present from town, everyone'll know
what it is.<wait><page>
So I decided I'd order one for her instead!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0316]
Yep! And it just came in. Don't ya breathe a word of this
to Lillia, y'hear?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0317]
Fine. Then I won't tell you. I'm not gonna share secrets
with someone who can't keep them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0318]
Girl's got a point. Nobody likes a blabbermouth, y'know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0319]
Anyway, I'm gonna head home and hide this. Thanks a lot,
Mr. Zack!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0320]
No prob! You keep that safe an' outta sight till the big
day, yeah?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0321]
I will!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0322]
Man, she sure grew up into a sweet kid who loves her ma.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0323]
It's me. How are you doing? ...Hmm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0324]
So you're not coming back? ...I see. All right.
I'll call you later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0325]
Was that Joanna?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0326]
Yes...<wait><page>
Mei's been waiting patiently for her, but it's been so long
and she still won't come home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0327]
I'm sure Joanna's got her reasons.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0328]
What could possibly be more important than your own
flesh and blood? Poor Mei. It breaks my old heart to see
her like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0329]
Now that you mention it, the last time she showed her
face here she just dropped Mei in your lap.<wait><page>
And then she was off again...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0330]
She's always been like that. No matter what happened,
she'd keep it all to herself to keep me from worrying.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0331]
But this time... This time I can't forgive her. Leaving her
own daughter here without a word as to why.<wait><page>
Mei tries to keep her chin up, but sometimes she just
looks so lonely.<wait><page>
She probably misses her mother. And when I see her
like that, I just can't bear it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0332]
Mei's still at the age where she needs her mom, after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0333]
Every time I call Joanna I tell her she needs to
come back.<wait><page>
But she always says she has things she needs to do
and won't listen to a word I say.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0334]
Well, then... I guess I'll make Mei's favorite food today.
Sorry for talking your ear off. If you'll excuse me...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0335]
It's me. Are you still doing all right?<wait><page>
I brought Mei today. She said she wanted to talk to
you too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0336]
I'm giving the phone to her now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0337]
Mommy? It's me, Mei.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0338]
Yep... Okay. I do everything Grandpa says, promise.<wait><page>
Uh-huh. Yeah...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0339]
Oh! Didja know a guy came to take care of that farm in
town?<wait><page>
Yeah... He's super cool! You should come back too, Mommy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0340]
Oh! Didja know a lady came to take care of that farm in
town?<wait><page>
Yeah... She's super cool! You should come back too,
Mommy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0341]
Oh... Okay... You can't come back yet, huh?<wait><page>
Yeah, you don't hafta worry about me. I'm giving the
phone back to Grandpa now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0342]
It's me again. ...Oh. I see.<wait><page>
Okay. I'll call again later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0343]
Were you talking to Joanna?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0344]
Yep! I sure was! It's been a long time... I'm so happy I got
to talk to her!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0345]
Well that's just great. Good for you, Mei!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0346]
Yep!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0347]
But...she said she can't come back yet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0348]
Oh yeah? That's...a bit disappointing, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0349]
Come on, Mei... Let's go home. Sorry for the bother,
Dudley.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0350]
Bye-bye!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0351]
Goodbye, Mei.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0352]
Hey there. Sorry to intrude on such a rainy day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0353]
Oh, don't you worry one bit, dear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0354]
I'm so glad you came over for a visit, Sai.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0355]
Indeed, here I am. Ho ho ho ho ho!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0356]
Eh? And if it isn't <playername>. How long've you
been there?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0357]
He's been there this whooooole time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0358]
She's been there this whooooole time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0359]
Hrm. Is that so?<wait><page>
Well, I think I'll be going now. Good day, Ellen.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0360]
Oh no. What ever is the matter, Sai? Your face is redder
than a beet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0361]
Thanks for stopping by, Sai.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0362]
Hi, Mr. Saibara!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0363]
Hello, Ellen. Yu. I just happened to be in the area,
so I thought I'd drop by.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0364]
Oh, you're always welcome, Sai.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0365]
If these legs of mine would just work the way they
used to, I'd pay you a little visit too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0366]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0367]
But as it is, I can't go out and about like I did before.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0368]
It seems like forever ago that you and I used to go to
the valley, the beach, the mountain...<wait><page>
Oh, how I miss those days. There's no way I could do
that now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0369]
Don't say that! I'm sure you'll get better.<wait><page>
And when you do, we'll go see the cherry blossoms
together in spring.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0370]
Oh, Sai. You're so sweet. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0371]
No, no... It's nothing. W-Well, then. I'll be going.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0372]
...Eh?! W-Well if it isn't <playername>! What are you
doing over there?! You here on b-business?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0373]
Um, Mr. Saibara... This is Grandma's house, remember?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0374]
O-Oh... Yes. Yes, of course. Well, then. If you'll excuse me...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0375]
Mr. Saibara's so weird!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0376]
Well, let's dig in, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0377]
Yeah, sure. Go ahead and try this... And this too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0378]
Huh. Pretty good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0379]
Right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0380]
Oh hey, <playername>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0384]
Yo, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0385]
What? You think it's weird for me to be at Kai's Cafe
or somethin'?<wait><page>
Well, I was invited way back, so I came.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0386]
Yep! I wanna get to know what the food scene is like
in this town a bit better.<wait><page>
And Gray's the only one I know well enough in town
to ask.<wait><page>
So I'm making him try out my new menu and grilling
him 'bout what he thinks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0387]
Well, I dunno much about cooking, but I know good food
when I taste it, and his stuff is good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0388]
Thanks, man! Hearing that makes it all worthwhile.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0389]
If I hang around too long, though, I'll get an earful
from Grandpa. I better head back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0390]
Yeah, sorry for taking up so much time. I know you're
super busy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0391]
See ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0392]
See you later. You too, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0393]
See you later. You too, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0394]
See you later. You too, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0395]
Gray's a good guy. We get along real well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0396]
He and I talk a lot at the Inn. This is the first time
he's been to my place, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0397]
While you're here, why not try out my menu too?
I can whip you up something delicious, I promise!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0398]
Good morning, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0399]
We'll be harvesting the grapes at the Vineyard
tomorrow. Would you lend a hand?<wait><page>
I will, of course, pay you for the trouble.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0400]
Sure!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0401]
Sorry, too busy.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0402]
Thanks. I appreciate it.<wait><page>
Check in with Manna at the house
at 10:00 AM, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0403]
Oh, and if you know anyone else who could help,
please invite them.<wait><page>
Say, how about asking that young man who is always
hanging around the Church?<wait><page>
It'll be easier the more people we have.
I'm counting on you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0404]
Yes, of course. I understand. You have your own work
to do.<wait><page>
Well, if you know anyone else who might be able to help,
tell them about it, would you?<wait><page>
Say, how about asking that young man who is always
hanging around the Church?<wait><page>
And if you change your mind, feel free to come on over.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0405]
We'd like your help until 5:00 PM. Is that okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0406]
Help
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0407]
Pass
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0408]
Hmm. You won't be able to do the job with your hands full.
Please put that away somewhere.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0409]
All right! Happy picking!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0410]
I'm expecting a good day's work out of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0411]
I expect a good day's work out of the pair of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0412]
I'll do my best.
<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0413]
Well done. Here's your pay. You were a great help today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0414]
Thank you for all your hard work. I'm sure you must be
quite thirsty now. Feel free to grab a drink.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0415]
The fruits of your labor are going to make quite
the vintage. Look forward to it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0416]
Oh yes, Cliff. If you've not got other work lined up,
how about sticking around to help out at the Vineyard?<wait><page>
The harvest may be over, but we've got plenty of other
things to do like processing the grapes and tending to
the vines.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0417]
Are you sure? Do you really think I can help?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0418]
We talked it over together. Our daughter has left town,
so it's just the two of us at the Vineyard now. An extra
pair of hands would be a lifesaver.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0419]
You're a hard worker, Cliff, and you're good with
your hands.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0420]
Yes! We'd be more than happy if you'd stay on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0421]
I... Thank you. I'll do my best to be of service to you both.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0422]
This is all because you invited me to help,
<playername>. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0423]
This is all because you invited me to help,
<playername>. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0424]
There's no need to apologize. I know you have your
own work. I'll just do what I can.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0425]
Well, I'd better get back to the farm, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0426]
Well, I'd better get back to the farm, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0427]
There's no need to apologize. You did bring Cliff to help,
after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0428]
I'll work hard enough for the both of us,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0429]

Cliff's working up a storm. I'd better get back to the
farm so he doesn't show me up.<wait>

Cliff's working up a storm. I'd better get back to the

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0432]
Dear! You've been drinking behind my back again,
haven't you?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0433]
I haven't had a single drop.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0434]
Don't you lie to me! What's this empty bottle under
our bed, then?! This isn't from our Vineyard!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0435]
Urgh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0436]
I...I was just doing some research to see how we stack up
against the competition!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0437]
Oooh, research, is it? Why is this "research" being
conducted while I sleep?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0438]
Oh, quit your nagging, woman! I can have a few drinks
if I want!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0439]
Enough! Didn't you say you weren't going to drink
anymore?! Try keeping your promises for once!
As it is, you can't stop once you've started,
and who is it that has to deal with you?! Me!
Do you know how much Adge hated to see you like that?
Even if she came back, she'd take one look at you
and leave again! And Cliff will, too. I won't forgive you
if we lose such a nice boy because of your nasty habits!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0440]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0441]
I've never said that you aren't allowed to drink ever
again. Even if I did, it would be impossible for
you anyway. But could you at least try to cut back?
I'm worried about your health too, you know...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0442]
Okay...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0443]
All right, then. I'll let you off the hook for today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0444]
Sorry you had to see that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0445]
I'm so sorry, <playername>. Here you came to visit
only to find us fighting with each other.
Please don't let it upset you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0446]
Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0447]
Oh, if it isn't <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0448]
Out for a bit of shopping, are we?<wait><page>
Oh, me? I came by to chat with Sasha and thought I'd
grab a few odds and ends while I was at it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0449]
What are you picking up today?<wait><page>
Ah, undecided still, huh? Well me, I'm buying things
for supper.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0450]
So...I think I'll take some onigiri and curry powder, please.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0451]
Onigiri and curry powder. Coming right up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0452]
My, my. Jeff, is it my imagination or have you gotten
smoother?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0453]
Uh...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0454]
Yes! There it is! There's no doubt about it.<wait><page>
I don't stop by for a few days and you suddenly become...
How should I put it? More assertive? More manly?<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0455]
Oh...do you think so?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0456]
Oh my, yes. The way you rattled off my list was just so
confident and bold. So...how much does that all come to?<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0457]
Oh, um... Well, I can give you a discount. H-Half off?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0458]
You're sure?<wait><page>
How gentlemanly! My husband could certainly learn
a thing or two from you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0459]
No, no. You're embarrassing me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0460]
That's the secret to shopping here, you know. Shower
Jeff with compliments and you'll be swimming in
discounts. Tee hee!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0461]
Manna has such a way with words.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0462]
Oh, Jeff. So soft and pliable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0463]
Hmmm...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0464]
Oh, <playername>. *sigh*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0465]
Oh, <playername>. *sigh*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0466]
You want to know what's wrong? Well, truth be told...<wait><page>
It seems that someone read one of my books--the one
about mushrooms, to be precise--and they...<wait><page>
Well, it seems they misunderstood it. Apparently,
they ate a poisonous mushroom by mistake.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0467]
And that person sent me an angry letter about it.
I don't quite know how to reply.<wait><page>
What do you think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0468]
Explain their mistake.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0469]
Apologize to them.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0470]
Yes... Yes, you're right.<wait><page>
If the reader has misunderstood, it's my duty to explain
their error.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0471]
Thank you, <playername>. I feel much better now.<wait><page>
I think I'll go ahead and write my reply.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0472]
Thank you, <playername>. I feel much better now.<wait><page>
I think I'll go ahead and write my reply.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0473]
I...see. You think so?<wait><page>
Perhaps I didn't write it correctly. I confess I've lost
a bit of confidence in myself.<wait><page>
Could you leave me alone for now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0474]
I think I'll write that reply now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0475]
Thanks to you, I know the right way to interact with
my readers. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0476]
Could you please leave me alone?<wait><page>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0497]
Oh my, <playername>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0498]
Hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0499]
You want to know what we're doing?
Desserts! Anna was just teaching me how to make all
kinds of sweet treats. She's quite the accomplished cook,
you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0500]
Oh no, not at all. You're embarrassing me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0501]
Ah, that's right! You spend a bit of time in the kitchen
on occasion, don't you, <playername>?
Why don't you take some dessert lessons from Anna
as well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0502]
Yes, please!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0503]
Sorry, too busy.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0504]
Oh really? All right, then. I'm happy to share my recipes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0505]
Okay, you two. Listen carefully.<wait><page>
We'll start with a simple Cake.<wait><page>
The main ingredients are Eggs, Wheat Flour, and Butter.
And Seasoning, of course.<wait><page>
Combine and bake, then let cool. Once it's not too hot,
spread creamy frosting on top, and ta-dah! It's done!<wait><page>
Easy, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0506]
I think I've got it. Any other tips or recipes you can share
with us?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0507]
Hmmm... I do have more, but won't it be hard to remember
so much at once?<wait><page>
Oh! Wait! I have an idea. Why not come by at this time
every Saturday, and I'll give you a lesson?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0508]
Really? What a wonderful idea!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0509]
Yes. Be sure to drop by. I'll teach you all my best recipes
if you do.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0510]
Great! You should come by too, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0511]
Awww... Please don't be like that. Everyone needs to
know how to cook.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0512]
Awww... Please don't be like that. Everyone needs to
know how to cook.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0513]
Yes, but I understand. <playername> is busy with the
farm. I guess there just isn't enough time for this sort
of thing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0514]
True... Farms DO take a lot of work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0515]
Well then, what would you like me to teach you, Manna?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0516]
Hmmm... My sponge cake always turns into a "brick cake."
Could you teach me how to make those?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0517]
All right. Sponge cake it is...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0518]
Well, now that all my students are here, let us begin
the lesson.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0519]
Yes, Mrs. Anna. Please start. Hee hee...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0520]
Now pay attention, class. Hee hee...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0521]
Let's see... How about I teach you how to make
Cookies today?<wait><page>
Everybody loves cookies, from the youngest of the young
to the oldest of the old.<wait><page>
The ingredients you need are an Egg, Wheat Flour,
and Butter. You'll also need a Rolling Pin, Oven,
and Seasoning.<wait><page>
Not too difficult, right? Now you'll have just the thing
for your sweetheart on a special day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0522]
Thank you very much, Mrs. Anna.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0523]
You're very welcome. Well then, I'll see you at the
next lesson.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0524]
For today's lesson, how about...Pudding? It's popular
among both children and adults.<wait><page>
You'll need an Egg and some Milk. And also a Pot, Oven,
and Seasoning.<wait><page>
The main ingredients are all very simple, which makes
this quite the easy recipe, don't you think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0525]
Let's see... Why don't we learn about Cheesecake today?
Its subtle flavor is very popular with adults.<wait><page>
You'll need Cheese, an Egg, and Milk. You'll also need
a Pot, Whisk, Oven, and Seasoning.<wait><page>
Remember that its charm is in its mellow flavor,
so don't go crazy with the seasoning!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0526]
For today...how about Apple Pie?<wait><page>
It's one of Ellen's favorites, you know.<wait><page>
You'll need an Apple, Egg, Wheat Flour, Butter, Knife,
Pot, Rolling Pin, and an Oven.<wait><page>
Oh, and Seasoning, of course. Making the dough can be
a bit tricky, but the results are well worth it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0527]
Oh no, you're very welcome. I think our next lesson will be
our last, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0528]
Awww, really?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0529]
Yes, I'm afraid so. Basil has started work on his next
book, so he'll need silence to focus.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0530]
I suppose there's nothing we can do, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0531]
I'm very sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0532]
Well then, for our last lesson I'll teach you how to make
Ice Cream. A cold treat, perfect for summertime.<wait><page>
You'll need Milk, an Egg, and Seasoning. Plus a Pot and
a Whisk.<wait><page>
Children absolutely adore ice cream.
Me too, if I'm honest!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0533]
And with that...class is dismissed!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0534]
Oh no, you're very welcome. I had a lot of fun
teaching you.<wait>

Hmmm... This plant is...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0552]
Oh? Hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0553]
Settled into married life yet? I'm sure it's quite the
change, but do your best.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0554]
Mm? What am I doing?<wait><page>
I'm looking for plants for Papa to use in his research.
He's working hard, so I want to do what I can to help him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0555]
How thoughtful!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0556]
As you should.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0557]
It's nothing, really.<wait><page>
It's something I've always done. I'm a little embarrassed
to be praised for it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0558]
Oh, I apologize for detaining you. I'll be heading back
home now.<wait><page>
I hope your work goes well too, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0559]
Yes, you're right. We're able to make a living because
of Papa's hard work.<wait><page>
If I could just get married, that would ease his burden
a little, though...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0560]
Good morning to you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0561]
Am I right in assuming this is the first time you've ever
worked on a farm? Please allow me to offer some advice.<wait><page>
To talk to a person standing in front of you or lift objects
next to you, press the Confirm Button.<wait><page>
Next, to use an item, make certain to equip it first, then
press the Tool Button to use it.<wait><page>
And when you need to do a bit of shopping, go to a store,
stand across the counter from the shopkeeper and talk
to them. However...<wait><page>
If the store is closed, you can still speak to the
shopkeeper, but you won't be able to buy anything.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0562]
There are several other controls available to you, as well.
Would you like for me to explain them too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0563]
All right. What would you like to know more about?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0564]
Raising Crops
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0565]
Tending Livestock
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0566]
Handy Options
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0567]
I'm good, thanks.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0568]
Are you sure? You needn't be so shy.<wait><page>
All right. If you insist.<wait><page>
If you ever have a question or feel confused about
anything, you can look it up by examining the Bookshelf
in your home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0569]
This is your farm, after all. You may do with it as
you wish.<wait><page>
Though, may I recommend focusing on earning a little
money first to make life a touch easier?<wait><page>
There are many things in the forest that you can forage
and ship for a little pocket change, for example.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0570]
And once your daily chores are finished, I suggest taking
a stroll about town and meeting the local residents.<wait><page>
If you follow the road from your farm to the right,
you will find your neighbors. I'm sure they'd be happy
to chat or give advice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0571]
Oh yes. One last thing. When you return home, check your
Tool Box. Inside you'll find a little gift.<wait><page>
It's just my old Pedometer, but I think you'll get some use
out of it.<wait><page>
Mineral Town is a large place, after all. It might be
interesting to see how many steps you've walked.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0572]
Now then, that ought to do for today. I'll drop by to see
how you're doing again soon. Good luck!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0573]
Yo! I'm Zack. I handle all the shippin' 'round these parts.
Nice t'meet ya!<wait><page>
When you're farmin', there's one big thing ya gotta
remember, yeah?<wait><page>
Here. I'll show ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0574]
See this? This is your Shipping Bin. Don't forget about it.<wait><page>
Ya wanna sell somethin'? Ya put it in the Bin. I come by
at 5:00 PM every day an' pick up whatever's in there.<wait><page>
When I do, I'll automatically add your cut of the sale
t'your wallet. Nifty, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0575]
Oh, but I don't come by t'collect on holidays or festival
days. Ya wanna know why?<wait><page>
'CUZ I WANT DAYS OFF TOO, DARN IT!
HYAHAHAHAHAHA!!!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0576]
Ah...ha ha...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0577]
Anyway. This ain't your only Shipping Bin. There's one
inside the Coop an' Barn, too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0578]
Ya can sell crops you've harvested or stuff ya foraged
from the mountain.<wait><page>
Oh, an' stuff like Eggs, Milk, an' Wool can go in there too.
Ya get the idea, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0579]
Okay, now listen up. This is important. Workin' hard
is great an' all, but don't overdo it.<wait><page>
If your face starts goin' blue, that's a sign you're about
t'keel over.<wait><page>
When ya get that bad, don't push it. Just go an' rest,
all right? Nobody wants a vacation to the Clinic.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0580]
Got all that? Good. I'll be stoppin' by at 5:00 PM, then.
See ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0581]
<playername>. I've come with a request that I can
only entrust to someone discreet and of good character.
I believe that someone is you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0582]
Oh yes. That's right. You are a young lady. I knew that.
Anyway, I would still like to request this of you.<wait>

[0596]
Of course!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0597]
No can do.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0598]
You will? Oh, I just knew I could count on you,
<playername>!<wait><page>
Now then, I have other business to attend to and won't

It seems I misjudged you, <playername>. Ah well.
I will simply have to manage by myself, then.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0604]
I asked you to get a Green Pepper. Please hurry and
bring one to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0605]
I asked you to get a Golden Egg. Please hurry and bring
one to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0606]
I asked you to get Black Grass. Please hurry and bring
one to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0607]
I asked you to get White Grass. Please hurry and bring
one to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0608]
I asked you to get a Matsutake. Please hurry and bring
one to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0609]
I asked you to get a Moonstone. Please hurry and bring
one to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0610]
I asked you to get an AEPFE Apple. Please hurry and
bring one to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0611]
I asked you to get Mochi. Please hurry and bring one
to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0612]
Aha! Yes! This is exactly it!<wait><page>
I knew coming to you was the correct choice!
Now, let me hurry to our lovely neighbors
and show off--AHEM.<wait><page>
Anyway. Here. Please accept this as a token of my
eternal gratitude.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0613]
This is called Golden Lumber. It is a highly valuable
building material.<wait><page>
Some years ago, using this to decorate outside your house
was frowned upon as a shameless display of opulence... <wait><page>
But no one pays it much mind these days. This lumber
won't rot in the rain, so if you'd like, you can make a
fence of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0614]
Now then, I must be on my way...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0615]
Oh, so close! That IS a diamond, yes, but I don't require
one with any color.<wait><page>
Please bring me just a plain, regular Diamond.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0616]
Yes, this is jewelry that Mr. Saibara made, but it isn't
quite what I requested.<wait><page>
If you could, please bring me a Bracelet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0617]
Unfortunately, this is not quite the egg I was looking for.<wait><page>
Could you please bring me a Golden Egg?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0618]
...A cooked egg. I see you have a ripe sense of humor.
However...<wait><page>
I need a Golden Egg, please. Uncooked and still in its shell!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0619]
I'm afraid this is not the right color of grass.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0620]
Please bring me Black Grass.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0621]
Please bring me White Grass.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0622]
Yes, there IS Matsutake in this, but I never said anything
about a meal!<wait><page>
I need a regular Matsutake, raw and uncooked,
if you please!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0623]
No, no, no. This isn't the right type of mushroom at all!<wait><page>
Please bring me a Matsutake. Ma-tsu-ta-ke!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0624]
No, no. If all I needed was a regular Apple, this wouldn't
be nearly so difficult!<wait><page>
Please bring me an AEPFE Apple.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0625]
Oh, so close! But I'm afraid this isn't quite the apple
I'm looking for.<wait><page>
Please bring me an AEPFE Apple.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0626]
Who asked for cooked apples?!<wait><page>
Please bring me an AEPFE Apple, raw and uncooked!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0627]
No, no, no. I don't need it to be cooked. Please bring me
regular, uncooked Mochi.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0628]
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you at this hour, but do you
have a moment? I'd like to ask for your advice on
something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0629]
I'm all ears.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0630]
Sorry, I'm busy.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0631]
I will get straight to the point. Have you heard of Adge,
Duke and Manna's daughter? Well, I love her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0632]
I would like to send her a letter, but I feel rather
awkward writing to her out of the blue.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0633]
That is when I remembered that you married the person
you fell in love with, <playername>.<wait><page>
Given your experience with love and relationships,
I thought you might have some advice for someone
in my position.<wait><page>
Do you have any suggestions for what I should do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0634]
Tell her how you feel.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0635]
Think it over yourself.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0636]
Hmm. I see. You might have a point there. Going back and
forth over it in my head will hardly get me anywhere,
after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0637]
Hmm. I see. You might have a point there. Going back and
forth over it in my head will hardly get me anywhere,
after all.<wait><page>
I'll do it, then. I'll write Adge a letter telling her exactly
how I feel.<wait><page>
Thank you, <playername>. That was just the push
I needed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0638]
...I see. I apologize for bothering you. Please excuse me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0639]
Ah, I see. I apologize for bothering you. Well then, I'll take
my leave. Be well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0640]
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0641]
Hm? I look down, you say? *sigh*<wait><page>
I am rather depressed, actually. You see, the other day
I wrote a letter to Adge explaining my feelings for her.<wait><page>
Today I received her reply.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0642]
It seems she has feelings for someone in the city where
she's living now.<wait><page>
Ah ha ha... I guess that's it, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0643]
No, no. Please don't worry about it.<wait><page>
In fact, I'm really grateful for the advice you gave me.
It was spot on.<wait><page>
By writing Adge that letter I was able to tell her how
I felt and hear her answer.<wait><page>
It may not have been the answer I wanted,
but it is what it is. I can move on now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0644]
Considering you were the one who advised me, I thought
it only right to let you know how it went.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0645]
Well then, stay safe and take care.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0646]
<playername>, welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0647]
Basil will be visiting today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0648]
Oh, welcome, Basil.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0649]
Hello there, Ellen. Thank you for having me over today.<wait><page>
Greetings, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0650]
Hello there, Ellen. Thank you for having me over today.<wait><page>
Greetings, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0651]
I came by to ask Ellen about a certain extraordinary
plant. Would you like to hear about it too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0652]
I came by to ask Ellen about a certain extraordinary
plant. Would you like to hear about it too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0653]
All right, then. Let's listen together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0654]
Okay, Ellen. Would you tell us what you know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0655]
Certainly. Now, this was long before you two were born,
but...<wait><page>
It's said that on summer nights a pure white flower can
be found blooming under the moonlight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0656]
The flower is called the Night-Blooming Cereus, and the
ones who saw it aren't around anymore.<wait><page>
But I'd like to see it once myself before I die.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0657]
The Night-Blooming Cereus... That's something I wouldn't
mind seeing myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0658]
<playername>. If you find that flower, could you
bring it to Ellen?<wait><page>
I'll be looking for it too, of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0659]
<playername>. If you find that flower, could you
bring it to Ellen?<wait><page>
I'll be looking for it too, of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0660]
All right, I'm going to do some research on it at my house.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0661]
I wish I could see it. Just once...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0662]
But maybe my dream will never come true...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0663]
Is this the Night-Blooming Cereus that Ellen mentioned?
In any case, I should try bringing it to her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0664]
Ah! That flower! Could it be...<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0665]
Wow! It sure is pretty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0666]
Th-That flower! How did you...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0667]
It's so beautiful. So this is the Night-Blooming Cereus.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0668]
Where did you find it, <playername>?<wait><page>
Hmm? At the mountain summit? So that's where it was...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0669]
Where did you find it, <playername>?<wait><page>
Hmm? At the mountain summit? So that's where it was...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0670]
Thank you, <playername>. I'll treasure it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0671]
Ellen's really happy!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0672]
Ellen's really happy!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0673]
<playername>, welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0674]
<playername>, welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0675]
Yaaay! It's <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0676]
Yaaay! It's <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0677]
Thank you for coming. Please make yourself at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0678]
How's work on the farm coming along? Is it keeping
you busy?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0679]
Farming takes a lot of dedication and has many
responsibilities. I think <playername> is doing
a fine job.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0680]
It sounds like I could learn a thing or two from you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0681]
You're doing a fine job too, Elly. Even on your day off
you're studying that book from the doctor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0682]
Yeah!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0683]
Oh, but that's nothing, really.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0684]
Ah! That's right. Speaking of books, I forgot to return
another one I'd borrowed from the doctor.<wait><page>
I'm sure it was on this shelf...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0685]
Yes, there it is.<wait><page>
I'll be returning this...oh.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0686]
What's the matter, dear?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0687]
When I took out the book, something fell down. It looks
like a letter.<wait><page>
It's addressed to you, Grandma.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0688]
Hmmm? A letter for me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0689]
Gracious me, this is from Grandpa!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0690]
From Grandpa?
<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0691]
What does it say?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0692]
Just hold your horses a moment. I'll read it aloud.
Let's see here...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0693]
"To my dearest Ellen, I'm writing this letter on the day
our wonderful granddaughter Elly was born.<wait><page>
I'm a grandpa now. I couldn't possibly be any happier.
I'm so glad I met you.<wait><page>
Thank you for everything.<wait><page>
I wonder when you'll read this letter? I'm too
embarrassed to give it to you, so I'm hiding it.<wait><page>
If you do end up reading this, just treasure it in your
heart...like I treasure you."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0694]
So he wrote that all those years ago. Oh, Grandpa...
He should have just given it to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0695]
Your grandpa always was a shy one.<wait><page>
I had no idea he'd written such a thing.<wait><page>
It's almost like he sent it from heaven. I'll have to put this
somewhere safe.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0696]
It's just like him to hide something in a place like that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0697]
He was terribly bashful, you know. Hahaha.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0698]
I never knew Grandpa was that shy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0699]
I'm so glad we found that. Grandma looks over the moon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0700]
Grandpa, huh? I wish I coulda met him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0701]
Oh my. Thank you.<wait><page>
Ah, I'll use this Wool to make you a Stocking to put
presents in for Starlight Night. I'll have it done in just
a jiffy!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0702]
Whoa! Ellen's knitting is lightning-fast!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0703]
And here you are!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0704]
Phew... That tuckered me out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0705]
I'm glad you like it. I'll have Yu bring it over to your
house later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0706]
I should hang that Stocking up on the wall.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0707]
Hee hee hee! Grandmaaa!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0708]
Oh? What now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0709]
Wouldja read me a book?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0710]
Yes, of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0711]
Oh, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0712]
Oh, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0713]
Ah, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0714]
Ah, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0715]
Deary me, welcome. I've not seen Yu so excited in ages.<wait><page>
He really seems to think of you like an older brother.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0716]
Deary me, welcome. I've not seen Yu so excited in ages.<wait><page>
He really seems to think of you like an older sister.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0717]
C'mon, let's play!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0718]
C'mon, let's play!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0719]
I'm game.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0720]
I'm busy!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0721]
Yu, come now. <playername> is probably very busy.
Are you sure you have the time?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0722]
Yu, come now. <playername> is probably very busy.
Are you sure you have the time?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0723]
Yaaay!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0724]
C'mon, let's play s'more!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0725]
C'mon, let's play s'more!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0726]
Yu, isn't that enough? I'm sure <playername> has lots
of work to do.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0727]
Yu, isn't that enough? I'm sure <playername> has lots
of work to do.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0728]
Yeah... Okay.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0729]
You should thank <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0730]
Thanks, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0731]
Thanks, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0732]
Thank you for spending some time with Yu.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0733]
You're welcome here any time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0734]
*sniffle* Waaah!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0735]
What were you expecting? <playername> has a lot of
work to do!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0736]
What were you expecting? <playername> has a lot of
work to do!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0737]
But... But... Waaaaaaah!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0738]
I'll console him, so could you leave now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0739]
Sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0740]
Hello, there. Welcome! Come on in!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0741]
Hello, <playername>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0742]
How goes the farm? If you need anything, feel free
to ask.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0743]
Yes, please do. We're not just saying this to be polite.
If you need any help, tell us.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0744]
Excuse me. Is anybody here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0745]
Goodness, who could that be? Excuse me. I'll be back in
just a moment.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0746]
Huh. Wonder who that is.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0747]
Dear, it seems you have a customer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0748]
Hello. You are the proprietor of this store, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0749]
I am. And you are?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0750]
I am Huang, a traveling merchant. It is nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0751]
It's nice to meet you too. How can I help you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0752]
You make paintings, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0753]
Hm? Yes, I do dabble a bit. But just as a hobby, really...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0754]
I happened to see one of your paintings once. It was
wonderful. So very wonderful. In fact, it moved me to
tears.<wait><page>
I would be honored if you would sell your paintings to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0755]
My word! I never expected anyone to want to buy my
husband's paintings. What a surprise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0756]
Madam, you are very blessed. Your husband has great
skill. I was very impressed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0757]
Why, thank you. Now, how much are you offering?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0758]
Hmmm, let me see. I will pay you 10,000G for each
painting. A good deal, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0759]
Oh my...! Dear, I really think you ought to consider selling.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0760]
Dear, I really think you ought to consider selling.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0761]
...I'm sorry. I'm afraid my paintings aren't for sale.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0762]
They aren't? Why not? Was my offer not enough?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0763]
Dear, why ever not? I don't think you'll see a deal this
good again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0764]
Sasha, I'm sorry. But...I don't paint for money.<wait><page>
When I create art, I'm taking what I find deep inside and
putting it on canvas for everyone to see.<wait><page>
If I ever sold those paintings... It would feel like I was
selling a piece of my heart.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0765]
Dear...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0766]
*sigh* I understand.<wait><page>
I thought my offer was strong, but it seems your will
is stronger.<wait><page>
I will not ask you to sell your paintings again. May you
have an auspicious day. Goodbye.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0767]
Goodness, dear...I think I've fallen for you all over again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0768]
R-Really? Ahahaha...<wait><page>
Well, ah, I'd best get back to work, then!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0769]
All right. Give it your best, dear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0770]
My, my. To think he had such conviction in him.<wait><page>
How dashing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0771]
How many times do I have to tell you to STOP
DOING THAT!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0772]
Eek! Oh...my ulcer...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0773]
Ah, er...welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0774]
Hold it right there! Don't think for a second that we're
done here!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0775]
Listen to this. My fool of a husband let another customer
browbeat him into selling our products on a tab again!<wait><page>
Dear, do you even understand what that does to us?
When you let them put it on a tab that means we get
NO MONEY!<wait><page>
At this point, <playername> is the only one who
actually pays us anymore!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0776]
Dear, do you even understand what that does to us?
When you let them put it on a tab that means we get
NO MONEY!<wait><page>
At this point, <playername> is the only one who
actually pays us anymore!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0777]
I do understand, darling, but everyone promises that
they'll pay us eventually.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0778]
Of course they do. Because "eventually" never comes!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0779]
Urk!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0780]
*SIGH* You're unbelievable. Completely hopeless.<wait><page>
You're a grown man, so start acting like one!
Straighten that spine! Find some guts!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0781]
The next customer that comes in had better leave us
with some money in our till or so help me I'll...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0782]
Okay, okay. I'll make sure to have our next customer pay
up front.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0783]
Oh look. Someone's here. <playername>, come on over.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0784]
Yo, Jeff.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0785]
Er, h-hello there, Duke.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0786]
Thought I'd duck in here to get out of the rain and do
a little shopping while I was at it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0787]
I-I see. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0788]
Great! I'll take some of this and this, then. Just put it on
my tab.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0789]
Um...Duke?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0790]
What, Jeff?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0791]
I n-need you to, erm, pay for that today. P-Please?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0792]
Huh? What do you mean? I just said to put it on my tab,
didn't I?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0793]
I-If you please, I really need you to pay for that today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0794]
We, er, won't be accepting anything on tab anymore!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0795]
...Okay, okay. No more tab. Got it. But I don't have any
money on me right now. You can come by and grab it
later, all right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0796]
O-Okay. I'll do that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0797]
You did it, dear! Well done!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0798]
Phew... I did, didn't I? I can hardly believe it myself.<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0799]
If you were able to stand up to Duke of all people, then
I'm sure you won't have problems with anyone else.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0800]
Yes, I think I ought to be fine now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0801]
I'm so proud of you, dear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0802]
Eheh heh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0803]
From now on, I think I'll be able to ask customers to pay
for what they buy up front! I think! Probably!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0804]
I really hope this does the trick, and he stops letting
customers put things on a tab...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0805]
If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you for some advice...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0806]
Oh? Ask away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0807]
It's about Adge.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0808]
Adge is your daughter, right? I've heard all about her but
not yet had the pleasure of meeting her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0809]
Yes. She got into a bit of an argument with her father
and stormed out of the house.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0810]
I see...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0811]
Have you heard anything from her lately?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0812]
Oh, yes. She writes to me regularly, but it's all just
pleasantries and idle chat. I want to know what
she really thinks, but I doubt she'll tell me.
And I don't want to leave things as they are...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0813]
Hmm, that is quite the pickle.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0814]
All right. Next time I hear from her I'll ask about
it offhandedly.<wait><page>
She might be more willing to open up about it to a friend
than her parents.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0815]
True, true.<wait><page>
The more a parent harps on a point, the more stubborn
the child gets. Doing it this way will probably net better
results.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0816]
Thanks, Sasha, Anna. I'm so glad I talked to you two
about this. All that confusion and anxiety I felt is gone
now. There truly isn't any greater treasure one can
have than friends.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0817]
Oh, come now. Where did all this mushiness come from?
A friend in need is a friend indeed, after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0818]
She's right, you know. Don't worry about it so much.
We're here to help you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0819]
Thank you, both of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0820]
So Adge got into a fight with Duke and stormed out of
the house, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0821]
Well then, why don't I think up a quick excuse to call her?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0822]
Manna's daughter is at a difficult age, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0823]
I also have a daughter, so I understand all too well just
how much she wants her baby girl to come back home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0824]
It's so wonderful to have friends one can trust
and lean on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0825]
I hope Sasha can convince Adge to come back home...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0826]
You've been married for quite a long time now,
haven't you, Sasha?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0827]
Oh, more years than I want to count.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0828]
Though, since you and Jeff are childhood friends, I guess
you could say you've been together your whole lives.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0829]
I suppose it does work out that way, doesn't it? Jeff has
never been able to get anything done without me, even as
a kid.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0830]
Haha. I still remember how he would follow you like your
little shadow everywhere you went.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0831]
Yep. At the first sign of trouble he'd zip right behind me,
quivering like a puppy. It was rather cute, actually.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0832]
*giggle* Why, I remember when Duke would pick on him.<wait><page>
You would come flying out of nowhere and rescue him,
sending Duke packing with a few good thwacks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0833]
Haha! Oh, the memories!<wait><page>
Jeff always did have the arm strength of a wet noodle.
Whenever he got into trouble, I had to go save him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0834]
Though, for all the nagging I have to do, I'm still really
grateful to have him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0835]
He gave me Karen and a wonderfully happy family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0836]
My, my! Well, aren't you all lovey-dovey! Tee hee.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0837]
Haha. I guess I am.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0838]
It must be so nice to have your husband around
all the time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0839]
Sasha and Jeff just make the most wonderful couple,
don't you think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0840]
Goodness, you heard all that? How embarrassing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0841]
Jeff has always been the sort of person that I just
couldn't leave be.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0842]
Aha! <playername>, perfect timing!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0843]
Aha! <playername>, perfect timing!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0844]
Duke has racked up a huge tab with us, and we were just
about to settle it with a little drinking contest.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0845]
Yep! If Karen wins, I'll pay up everything I owe on
the spot.<wait><page>
But if I win, Karen said she'll write the whole thing off.<wait><page>
Sounds like a fun little wager, don't you think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0846]
So, yeah. I'd like it if you could watch and, y'know, witness
stuff for us, <playername>. Will you do it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0847]
So, yeah. I'd like it if you could watch and, y'know, witness
stuff for us, <playername>. Will you do it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0848]
This is stupid...
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0849]
Sure thing.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0850]
Hey! I'm serious about this, y'know! Well if that's how
you're gonna be, forget it!<wait><page>
You can just sit there and watch. Duke, let's do this!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0851]
Hey! I'm serious about this, y'know! Well if that's how
you're gonna be, forget it!<wait><page>
You can just sit there and watch. Duke, let's do this!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0852]
You're on, Karen!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0853]
Great! I knew you'd get it, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0854]
Great! I knew you'd get it, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0855]
All right, Duke! Let's do this!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0856]
You're on, Karen!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0857]
Ha...! Is that it? You never even stood a chance
against me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0858]
I'm going home. I'll expect your tab to be paid up in full by
the end of the day. Got it? Good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0859]
Hey, <playername>? Could you do me a favor and help
Duke get home?<wait><page>
I can't leave him lying around on the floor like this...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0860]
Thanks. Be careful with him, all right? He looks fit to pop.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0861]
...-ing...?
...-arling?
Darling.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0862]
Mnnngh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0863]
DARLING!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0864]
WH-WHAAAT?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0865]
Don't you "what" me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0866]
Ugh. My stomach feels like it's going to burst...!
Why are you yelling in my ear like that?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0867]
<playername> told me everything. You got into a
drinking contest with Karen of all people?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0868]
Oh, yeah! I did, I did. So how'd it turn out?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0869]
You lost. Big time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0870]
Ah, I lost, huh? Karen sure knows how to hold her juice!
Bwahahahaha!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0871]
This is no laughing matter! You made a bet with her that
if you lost, you'd pay off your "tab," right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0872]
Geh! Oh, yeah. That part.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0873]
You've been buying things without telling me again!
What did you get this time?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0874]
Ummm... I, ah--whatever! It was nothing!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0875]
Anyway, a promise is a promise. Guess I'll go pay up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0876]
I'll deduct it from your allowance!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0877]
Ugh... Okay, okay. Fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0878]
Hold it! <playername> dragged your sorry self all
the way home, you know. How about first you
apologize for that!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0879]
Uh, right. Sorry about that, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0880]
<playername>, I can't apologize enough for this
blockhead and his stupidity.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0881]
Hey! That's your husband you're calling a blockhead,
you know!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0882]
I see nothing wrong with calling a blockhead a blockhead!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0883]
Uh oh. Sounds like that's my cue to exit...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0884]
Welcome, customer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0885]
Yo! Good to see ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0886]
I have nothing but the best wares, yes? Anything and
everything you need. Look as much as you like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0887]
Hello!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0888]
Yo, Karen! What's up? Don't see ya 'round here much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0889]
Well, I was at the beach anyway, so I figured I might as
well drop by.<wait><page>
I heard someone new had set up shop nearby too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0890]
Oh my! What a lovely young lady!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0891]
Hm? Who're you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0892]
Who, him?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0893]
My name is Huang. I am a merchant. I am honored to
meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0894]
Oh, you must be the one with the new store.<wait><page>
Hi. I'm Karen. Nice to meet you too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0895]
Your name is Karen? An elegant name for an
elegant lady.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0896]
Why, thank you.<wait><page>
Oh yeah. If you have a store, can I see what
you're selling?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0897]
Yes, of course. Here. Look as much as you please.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0898]
<playername>! You are in the way, yes? Please move
to the side.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0899]
You are in the way of my business. Please move!<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0900]
Huh. That's quite the interesting selection you've got.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0901]
Karen, today is your lucky day. Now happens to be
"Super Special Bargain Time." One item, any you
like, for free.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0902]
Wow, really? Score! ♪<wait><page>
Then I'll take...this!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0903]
A most excellent choice, Karen. Please, take it. I will
accept no money, but you will come see me again, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0904]
Sure thing! Thanks a bunch. See you later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0905]
Yo, so it's Super Special Bargain Time now, eh?
I want somethin' too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0906]
Sorry. Super Special Bargain Time is over now. I will be
accepting payment for what you buy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0907]
Aww, got my hopes all up too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0908]
The world is a cold, cruel place, yes? Now pay for what
you buy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0909]
Oh, it's you.<wait><page>
I seem down, do I? You're wondering if even physicians
can get sick?<wait><page>
No, no. It's nothing like that. I was just thinking about
my parents.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0910]
My family has a long history of being healers.
My father was a physician, and my mother a nurse.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0911]
Our clinic was always busy. As a child, my parents never
seemed to have time for me, and I was very lonely.<wait><page>
There were even times that I hated the profession.
I fought with them on occasion about it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0912]
But once I became one myself, I came to understand
where they were coming from.<wait><page>
It's hard to be responsible for the life of another.
If I had known then what I know now, I never would
have pushed as I did.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0913]
Oh, forgive me. I shouldn't be burdening you with my
regrets. Please forget about all this.<wait><page>
...I should be going.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0914]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0915]
What?! What does that mean?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0916]
It means what it means.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0917]
N-No... So I was wrong this whole time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0918]
Facts are facts. Please don't let it bother you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0919]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0920]
Oh, <playername>. What's the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0921]
Oh, <nickname>. What's the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0922]
You heard us all the way from the waiting room?
Ah, that's unfortunate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0923]
Well, the truth is that we have just learned something
very important about Jeff's body.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0924]
Yeah...<wait><page>
Apparently, I don't have the blood type I thought I had.
And I was so sure this whole time too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0925]
I sincerely apologize. There must have been some
mistake before.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0926]
*siiigh*<wait><page>
And here I thought all those fortunes based on blood type
were spot on. I was so wrong...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0927]
It certainly is strange, though. I can't imagine how I mixed
that up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0928]
I'll have to tell Sasha when I get home. She always
thought it was odd.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0929]
She kept saying it was weird for that blood type to have
such a timid personality. She was right.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0930]
Even doctors are only human. I certainly always seem
to be doing something wrong.<wait><page>
But this is the first time I've ever seen him make
a mistake.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0931]
Hmmm... Doctor, I don't quite understand this part.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0932]
Which part? Ah yes, that. It's like this, and...there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0933]
Oh, I see! You're so talented, Doctor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0934]
If there's ever anything you don't understand,
don't hesitate to ask.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0935]
I won't. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0936]
Hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0937]
Hi, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0938]
Hi, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0939]
Hm? You're wondering what I was doing?<wait><page>
I'm studying medicine. I want to find a way to make
Grandma's legs better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0940]
I'm sure you will.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0941]
Try another clinic.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0942]
Thank you for the encouragement. I'll do my best!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0943]
With such exemplary work ethic as you have, I'm certain
you'll be able to help your grandmother.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0944]
Thank you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0945]
Hm? Another clinic?<wait><page>
Grandma is quite set against leaving this town, though.
I don't want to upset her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0946]
The patient's state of mind is key to recovery. If that's
what Ellen wishes, it's best to keep her here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0947]
Yes, exactly!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0948]
I believe in Elly. I'm certain she'll achieve her goal.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0949]
I pledge to find a way to heal Grandma's legs.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0950]
Yu, let's go to the Clinic and have the doctor take a look
at you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0951]
Yes, yes. I think that's for the best.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0952]
I don't wanna! I'm fine!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0953]
That's enough! You may look fine, but you have a fever!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0954]
Sheesh. You're such a worrywart.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0955]
Please, can we just go to the Clinic?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0956]
Awww, Sis...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0957]
Fine. I'll go.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0958]
Oh, <playername>. Perfect timing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0959]
Oh, <playername>. Perfect timing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0960]
I think Yu's sick. I'm sorry to be a bother, but could you
help me take him to the Clinic?<wait><page>
It's closed today, but I'll find Doctor and ask him to have
a look.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0961]
Thank you. If you would then, please.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0962]
Mmmm, looks to be just a simple cold. Keep him warm,
let him rest, and he'll be fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0963]
Really? That's a relief.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0964]
See? I told you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0965]
Ugh, that's enough! Do you have any idea how worried
I was?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0966]
...Sorry, Elly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0967]
Go on, then. Thank <playername> and Doctor for
helping.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0968]
Go on, then. Thank <playername> and Doctor for
helping.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0969]
Thanks, you guys!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0970]
Thanks, you two!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0971]
<nickname>, could you help bring Yu home,
just in case?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0972]
<playername>, could you help bring Yu home,
just in case?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0973]
Ah, <playername>! Listen to this!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0974]
Ah, <playername>! Listen to this!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0975]
I was resting my eyes in the Confessional--spiritual
contemplation, you see--when I heard someone whisper
something to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0976]
They said good fortune would grace my path.<wait><page>
It was surely just an idle fancy from my...meditation,
but I can't stop thinking about it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0977]
Yo, Carter! Ya here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0978]
Is something the matter? I don't often see you at this
time of the day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0979]
I came t'tell ya that the thing ya wanted came in.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0980]
Oh? You managed to get your hands on it, then?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0981]
I couldn't find the darn thing anywhere, but I just got a
call sayin' they had it in stock.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0982]
I see. Thank you very much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0983]
Drop by the shop in a bit, and it should be ready. See ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0984]
Ah. It seems that daydream, I mean, sign from above came
to pass, after all.<wait><page>
Perhaps I should engage in restful contemplation in the
Confessional more often...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0985]
Hm? You want to know what I ordered? Hahaha...
I'm afraid that's a secret, for the time being.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0986]
Carter doesn't seem to be around. Where'd he go?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0987]
The door's open. Maybe I'll peek inside.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0988]
Ahhh, autumn is truly the best season. Even I, a penniless
priest, can live in luxury this time of year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0989]
I must keep this secret from the children. Hahaha...
Heeheehee... Now, time to partake.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0990]
<playername>? What are you doing here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0991]
<playername>? What are you doing here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0992]
The door was open? I can't believe I was so careless.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0993]
You want to know what I was doing? I was...cleaning.
Y-Yes. Just a bit of simple autumn cleaning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0994]
Please don't look at me like that. All right. I confess.<wait><page>
The truth is, I've been picking mushrooms.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0995]
Mushrooms are abundant here, and come autumn they
mature enough to eat.<wait><page>
The, ah, frugal nature of my calling means such luxuries
are a rare treat. It's the only time I can really indulge.<wait><page>
I was afraid of others stealing my joy away, so I've kept
it secret.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0996]
<playername>, I beg you. Could you keep this
between us?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0997]
<playername>, I beg you. Could you keep this
between us?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0998]
Thank you very much.<wait><page>
In gratitude, I'll keep the back door unlocked for you from
now on. Please, come and go as you like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0999]
Now, if you'll pardon me...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1000]
I'll head back inside now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1001]
Yes, of course. It borders on avarice to keep such things
all to myself. I understand.<wait><page>
From now on, I'll keep the back door unlocked for you.
Come and go as you please.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1002]
Carter's asleep. I should leave him be.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1003]
Snow always brings me back. It was snowing the day
I left my hometown too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1004]
Welcome. It's a real blizzard out there, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1005]
Huh? Cliff...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1006]
Dad! It's an emergency! Cliff is...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1007]
It's a good thing you found him, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1008]
It's a good thing you found him, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1009]
Truly fortunate, indeed. Whatever was he doing out
there, I wonder.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1010]
Thank you so, so much. You even helped carry him to
the Clinic.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1011]
He should be fine after some rest. You should all return
home for the time being. Be sure not to catch a cold.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1012]
This photo! Where did you find it?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1013]
Oh... Huh. So you told Ran and the others.<wait><page>
The people in this picture are my mother and little sister.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1014]
I...hated the town where I grew up, so I left. I ran away
and abandoned my mother and sister.<wait><page>
When I came back, they were gone. My mother had
passed away, and my sister had disappeared.<wait><page>
So I wandered around on my own with nowhere to go
until I arrived here.<wait><page>
It's...a lot like my hometown.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1015]
Ah! Sorry! I'm sure you don't want to hear about all that.<wait><page>
Thank you...for finding this picture.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1016]
You're really leaving?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1017]
Yeah. Thanks for taking care of me.<wait><page>
This place...is just too nice for someone like me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1018]
You idiot! "Too nice" isn't a bad thing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1019]
Thank you very much. Please say goodbye to everyone
for me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1020]
I will. I haven't said anything to Ran. She'll be sad to see
you go, you know. She likes you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1021]
...I'll be going now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1022]
<playername>... I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.
It'd be best if you just forgot about me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1023]
<playername>... I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.
It'd be best if you just forgot about me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1024]
Thank you for everything. Really.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1025]
You're always welcome here! So come back any time!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1026]
Today...is the day Ran's mother passed away.<wait><page>
This one day of the year, Ran lets me have off. I really
appreciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1027]
I like to spend the whole day just thinking about her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1028]
Quit it already, you two!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1029]
Stay out of it, Ran!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1030]
Ran, don't you try and stop us!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1031]
Oh, <playername>. Please help! They won't stop
fighting!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1032]
Oh, <playername>. Please help! They won't stop
fighting!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1033]
Intervene
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1034]
Don't interfere
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1035]
Thanks! You got this!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1036]
What do you want, <playername>?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1037]
Out of the way, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1038]
Huh? You wanna know why we're fighting?
Well, obviously...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1039]
Well, obviously we're fighting about...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1040]
...Uh.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1041]
What exactly were we arguing about again?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1042]
Seriously?! You can't even remember what you were
fighting about? I'm so done with you two.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1043]
Well, shoot. It's completely slipped my mind. Sorry,
<playername>. We'll stop now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1044]
Yeah, we're done.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1045]
Thanks, <playername>.<wait><page>
I'll be givin' them both an earful, don't you worry!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1046]
Thanks, <playername>.<wait><page>
I'll be givin' them both an earful, don't you worry!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1047]
What? We can't just do nothing!<wait><page>
Fine! Geez. I guess I can't count on you for anything,
<playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1048]
What? We can't just do nothing!<wait><page>
Fine! Geez. I guess I can't count on you for anything,
<playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1049]
I can't believe I forgot why we were fighting. Am I that
old already? Anyway, sorry you had to see that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1050]
Sorry for all the trouble, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1051]
Hmph. I can't just let this go. He's the one who started it
anyway.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1052]
Ugh. I wish my dad would stop getting all worked up over
nothing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1053]
You two need to knock it off. Honestly, you're acting like
a bunch of kids.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1054]
Phew. I'm glad they stopped. It's terribly hard to enjoy
one's meal over all that shouting.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1055]
I can eat in peace now thanks to you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1056]
I wonder what they were fighting about.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1057]
This tense atmosphere has soured my meal.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1058]
Ahaha, sorry about that. I got a little carried away.
Proves I still have some fire in my belly, though!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1059]
Don't talk to me right now. I won't be responsible if you
get hurt. I'm settling this once and for all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1060]
I'm settling this once and for all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1061]
Hrm. I wasn't sure what was going to happen for a
moment there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1062]
Thanks for stepping in. Once those two start, they can be
a bit of a handful by myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1063]
Maybe I should step in and stop them...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1064]
But can I handle both of them by myself?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1065]
Hello, <playername>! Sorry, but I'm a bit busy right
now. If you need something, it'll have to wait for later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1066]
Dad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1067]
What is it, Ran? Did something happen?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1068]
No, everything's fine. I just wanted to give you something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1069]
Hmm? What's all this now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1070]
Here. Take it. It's a present!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1071]
What? Wait, this is...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1072]
So you did forget! Today's your birthday, isn't it?
Get it together already. Geez.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1073]
Oh yeah! It IS my birthday!<wait><page>
It'd completely slipped my mind. Thanks, honey.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1074]
Hope you like it! I'm gonna get to work now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1075]
Yeah, thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1076]
Daughters are just the best. I'm going to work extra hard
now to be the best dad, too!<wait>

Yo, <playername>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1089]
Yo, <nickname>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1090]
Not too many people in today. Not that it ever gets that
busy, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1091]
Ah well. No point worrying 'bout it. That's life, right?
It is what it is.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1092]
Still... I like to think my food's pretty good.<wait><page>
So how come I'm not getting more customers?
Talk about a mystery.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1093]
Kai!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1094]
Yo, Popuri! What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1095]
Guess what, guess what! I brought a whooooole buncha
customers for you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1096]
What? Seriously? Cool! Tha--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1097]
All right, everyone! Come on in!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1098]
Don't worry! There's more! I asked TONS of people
to come!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1099]
Holy smokes! That's way too many!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1100]
<playername>, there's no way I can handle this many
customers all by myself. You gotta help me out! Please!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1101]
<nickname>, there's no way I can handle this many
customers all by myself. You gotta help me out! Please!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1102]
Phew! Man, I am BEAT!<wait><page>
Popuri, I'm super happy that you'd bring customers for
me, but that was waaaaay too many.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1103]
Aww... I thought that if a few customers would make you
happy, then a whole bunch would make you even happier.
I'm sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1104]
Y'know what? I've got a whole new appreciation for the
slow times now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1105]
<playername>, you really saved my bacon today.
Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1106]
<nickname>, you really saved my bacon today.
Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1107]
Boy, am I tired after all that. I think I'll go home and hit
the sack.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1108]
Ah! Look! It's Kai! Hi, Kai!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1109]
Hey, Kai! Been a while, huh?<wait><page>
You know, when you get here it feels like it's finally time
for summer to start.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1110]
Thanks, Popuri. I'll be throwing the doors of the Beach
Cafe open in two days, so come on by!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1111]
Yay!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1112]
See you later, Kai!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1113]
Hm? Hey there, um...? I don't remember seeing you here
last year.<wait><page>
I'm Kai. Nice to meetcha.<wait><page>
I run the little Cafe down on the beach.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1114]
I'm only open during the summer, but come on by if you
want a quick bite of some tasty food.<wait><page>
Tasty food for sale, that is. Gotta make hay while the
summer sun shines, right? Hope to see ya there!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1115]
Yo, how's it going? Been a while since I've seen you,
<playername>.<wait><page>
I'll be around all summer, so I hope to see you around too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1116]
Yo, how's it hanging, <playername>? Been a while,
huh? I'm looking forward to seeing you around.<wait><page>
I'll be here all summer again, so don't be a stranger,
you hear?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1117]
Yo, how're things, <playername>? It feels like forever
since I saw you. Man, I feel bad about being gone that
long.<wait><page>
I'll be around all summer again, though, so let's pick up
where we left off, 'kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1118]
Summer's already over, huh? I'll be closing down the Cafe
and heading to another town when it ends, so figured I'd
say goodbye.<wait><page>
So...yeah. Hope to see you again next year. Later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1119]
Summer's already over, huh? I'll be heading off soon,
so I thought I'd say my goodbyes.<wait><page>
So...yeah. Hate to be leaving you behind like this,
but I just gotta go, y'know?<wait><page>
I'll be counting the days till I can see you again next year.
Wait for me, 'kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1122]
AAAAARGH! Dagnabbit! I don't got the energy to do
nothin' at all!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1123]
Hn? Ah, <playername>. Sorry to startle you like that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1124]
What? You here to hire me for some renovations or
somethin'? If that's the case, I'll hafta ask you to come
back later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1125]
Right now all my get-up-and-go has got up and went.
I'm stuck in a rut but good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1126]
I'll get out of it eventually, I know. Just gotta find a way
to kick start my engine. But until then, work's a no-go.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1127]
Yo, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1128]
I finally got my pep back! Sorry to worry you like that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1129]
Lookin' to do some upgrades on the house?<wait><page>
If that's the case, then I'm your man!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1130]
G'day, officer. Some nice patrollin' you're doin' there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1131]
Thank you. Things are quiet and peaceful as usual.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1132]
That's good to hear. Haven't seen anythin' out of the
ordinary mountain-side, either.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1133]
Wonderful. Thank you, as always.<wait><page>
Honestly, I ought to check that area out myself.
You're doing me a great service, Mr. Gotts.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1134]
Nah. It's no big deal. Besides, I know the mountain better
than anyone. Who better to check it, then, eh?<wait><page>
I asked to do the job. You don't gotta feel guilty 'bout it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1135]
...It's been quite some time since your wife and daughter
passed away on the mountain, hasn't it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1136]
Yeah, that it has. I know they both wouldn't want no one
to go through what they did.<wait><page>
I'm sure that wherever they are, they're happy I'm the
one watchin' over the mountain for them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1137]
Yes. I'm sure they are.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1138]
Mr. Gotts' wife and daughter passed away some
time ago.<wait><page>
Since the accident, he's been doing regular patrols
of the mountain when he can find time away from
his work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1139]
I am very grateful for everything he does.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1140]
You take care when you go up the mountain, y'hear?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1141]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1142]
My, my! It's rare we get a visit from you, Zack.
What brings you to our home today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1143]
O-Oh, ah, n-not much. Just happened t'be passin' by,
that's all. So, uh... How're ya doin'?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1144]
H-How're ya doin'?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1145]
Oh, I've been feeling just wonderful these last few days.
I'm so sorry if I worried you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1146]
N-Nah, not at all. I'm just glad t'hear you're gettin' on
all right.<wait><page>
Whenever I hear you've had a bad spell, I just can't sleep
at night.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1147]
Whenever I hear you've had a bad spell, I just can't sleep
at night.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1148]
Oh, Zack... I never knew you cared so much. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1149]
Y-Yeah, I do... A lot. You...you've finally noticed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1150]
Yes. I'll make sure I get better very soon, so I don't ever
worry you again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1151]
Huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1152]
Hm? Is something the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1153]
Um, n-nothin'. Yeah, uh, I hope you get better real soon
too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1154]
Yes. I'll do everything I can. Thank you so much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1155]
N-No, problem. Well, uh...I guess I'd better get goin'.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1156]
All right. Take care!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1157]
Yo, <playername>. How's it goin'? Me? I...I'm headin'
home. *SIGH*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1158]
Goodness, poor Zack seemed so dispirited when he left.
I wonder what's bothering him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1159]
Poor Zack always seems so shy whenever he talks to me.
And he trips over his tongue a lot. I wonder why.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1160]
Hrmmm... Now what am I gonna do with this?
It'd be a waste t'just toss it...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1161]
Yo, <playername>. Good timin'! I was just wonderin'
what I should do with this thing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1162]
See, an old buddy of mine moved out an' left his Fishin'
Rod behind. Me, I don't fish.<wait><page>
So I was wonderin' what t'do with the darn thing.<wait><page>
It's still in good shape, so it'd be a shame t'junk it.<wait><page>
What d'ya say, <playername>? Want it?<wait><page>
I've got an inklin' that you've got a talent for fishin'.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1163]
I got a Fishing Rod!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1164]
Now get on out there an' fish up a storm!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1165]
Ahhh. You have gotten a good item, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1166]
Yo, <playername>! I heard the news!<wait><page>
So you've caught at least one of every kind of fish
out there, eh? Not bad, not bad!<wait><page>
I just knew you were good at fishin'. Didn't I say so?
That rod definitely went to the right person.<wait><page>
Man, if my old buddy heard about this, he'd flip!<wait><page>
But just 'cuz you caught a lot of fish don't mean you
should stop now. Keep reelin' 'em in! See ya later!<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1167]
Good morning. I am sorry to disturb you at this
early hour.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1168]
Ah. I humbly apologize. I have not introduced myself.
I am Huang, a traveling merchant.<wait><page>
I have just arrived in this town. It is an honor to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1169]
I see you have a farm, yes?<wait><page>
As it so happens, I have many seeds for sale.
Rare seeds. Unique seeds. Come see my wares, buy them.<wait><page>
Mr. Zack has generously allowed me to stay at his home.
I have opened my store there.<wait><page>
Come whenever you like. I always welcome
new customers.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1170]
Now I must go and greet the other customers in town.
Goodbye.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1171]
Good morning. I am sorry to disturb you at this
early hour.<wait><page>
Today I bring a special bargain, just for you.
Three exotic fruit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1172]
They are just for you. You only. No one else.<wait><page>
Ta-dah! Three rare apples. But...they are not just any
apples.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1173]
The first is this one. It is named...the SUGDW Apple!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1174]
That is the short version. The full name is very long,
so listen well. Ready?<wait><page>
It is the Super Ultra Great Delicious Wonderful Apple!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1175]
*pant* *pant* *pant* A very long name, yes? Very long.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1176]
The second is this apple. It is...the HMSGB Apple!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1177]
This apple, too, has very long name. So listen well...<wait><page>
It is the Hyper Miracle Sweet Gorgeous Beautiful Apple!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1178]
Last but not least...the AEPFE Apple!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1179]
As with the others, its name is quite long. Are you ready?<wait><page>
It is the Angel Eternal Pure Fresh Elegant Apple!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1180]
All three are special apples. Very special. How special you
will see when you eat them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1181]
But I will sell them to you for a special bargain price.
Only 500G each. Quite the steal, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1182]
Which will you buy?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1183]
The SUGDW Apple.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1184]
The HMSGB Apple.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1185]
The AEPFE Apple.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1186]
Sorry, not interested.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1187]
Thank you very much for your purchase! I did not think
anyone would actually buy them...<wait><page>
Ahem! I mean, you have very good taste, dear customer.
Very good. Now I must go. Goodbye.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1188]
You do not have 500G?
My friend, you have very poor luck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1189]
Good morning. I am sorry to disturb you at this
early hour.<wait><page>
I notice your house is very nice. Very good feng shui.
For you and your nice house, I bring a special bargain.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1190]
Even the nicest houses can feel lonely sometimes.<wait><page>
To make sure it is not lonely, I offer you this Vase!
Only 5,000G. It will make your whole house pretty
and happy. Quite a deal, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1191]
Buy
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1192]
Don't buy
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1193]
And this is a special Vase. It has a very unique feature.
You can put flowers in it! That will make your whole
house even happier.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1194]
Just a Vase alone, it doesn't do much, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1195]
Having useless decorations makes the heart feel good.
But! Having nothing makes it feel sad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1196]
Good day. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance
and my honor to offer a few trifles for sale in this
lovely town.<wait><page>
I will be showcasing my wares every Wednesday on the
second floor of the Inn.<wait><page>
I trade in several unique and difficult to find items,
so I highly recommend you pay me a visit.<wait><page>
I also open a Pet Shop on the 15th of each month
in the Plaza.<wait><page>
This, of course, excludes months when a festival falls
on the 15th. That takes precedence!<wait><page>
Now then, I'm afraid I must excuse myself. Goodbye.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1197]
G'morning! I'm Lou. Nice to meet ya! I'll be dropping by
Mineral Town to buy ingredients every once in a while.<wait><page>
I've heard all about the good stuff you can get here,
so I figured I'd snag some for myself.<wait><page>
I run a little inn, you see, and I love to cook for my guests.
You'll find me at the Inn every Sunday. Come on by and
say hi!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1198]
Oookay! Everybody in their seats?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1199]
YES!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1200]
Good! Let's begin...the Nature Sprites' Tea Party!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1201]
Tea parties are so fun!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1202]
<playername>, you're our guest today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1203]
We give presents to our guests. Here!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1204]
I hope you'll come back next year. We'll all be waiting to
see you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1205]
Pan paka paaan! Congratulations!<wait><page>
<playername>, you've collected all of the Goddess
Jewels! As a special prize, I will trade you all of them
for...<wait><page>
Ta-daaaaah! ♪ This one of a kind Goddess' Treasure! ♪
Enjoy! Bye-bye now!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1206]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1207]
You collected all Kappa Jewels. I trade you them for
Kappa's Treasure. Go away and don't come back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1208]
How... How could you do something like that? I'm so
disappointed in you. If anything happens, don't come
crying to me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1209]
I expected better of you, <playername>. You think
you're big stuff, huh? Well, from now on I'm going to call
you Money Pants!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1210]
I don't have to tell you why I'm mad, do I? No, siree. You
best think on what you did! You think REAL hard, you
hear?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1211]
I hate you, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1212]
I hate you, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1213]
Bah! Young folk these days! No manners at all! I just
can't understand what's going on in their rotten little
minds.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1214]
Do you know what you've done? I don't mind a good joke,
but this is just tasteless. Knock it off!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1215]
My goodness. It's just unbelievable! Now, I know you're
young yet, and young people make mistakes.
But this? This is no small matter. I don't know if you'll
ever be able to make up for it, but you'd best try!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1216]
I can't believe what you've done. You...you...! You've
practically desecrated Mother Nature herself!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1217]
It's just shocking. I don't even know what to say.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1218]
Is it any wonder everyone is upset? I warned you that
Golden Lumber would do this!<wait><page>
But you still went and displayed it on your farm anyway,
and now the whole town is in an uproar! Take it down at
once!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1219]
The citizens of Mineral Town are quite upset at your, ah,
decoration. I suggest you take it down at once or I will
arrest you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1220]
Whoa. I know I play pranks on people, but even I wouldn't
go this far. You're a monster, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1221]
Whoa. I know I play pranks on people, but even I wouldn't
go this far. You're a monster, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1222]
You know, it takes an awful lot to make me angry, but
this has done it. I am good and mad at you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1223]
What on earth did you think you were doing? Take that
shameless thing down at once!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1224]
You may be wealthy in riches, but your soul is poor and
barren.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1225]
You're unbelievable. What, do you need people to get mad
at you before you understand?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1226]
I guess you weren't the man I took you for. You aren't a
man at all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1227]
You're unbelievable. What, do you need people to get mad
at you before you understand?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1228]
Yo, take that tacky thing down already! Ain'tcha
embarrassed?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1229]
I heard rumor of your latest, ah...faux pas even all the
way over in my town.<wait><page>
How absolutely distasteful. You ought to be ashamed of
yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1230]
Oh my, my, my. Now you've done it. Even the gods are
angry with you. I think you had better take that down,
pronto.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1231]
Outrageous! You still have that garish Golden Lumber up!
What unbelievable gall!<wait><page>
It's an eyesore that degrades the entire town. Remove it
AT ONCE!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1232]
<playername>, I see that you have found the last
of the Truth Jewels. Could I ask you to come with
me for a moment?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1233]
<playername>, since you've collected all of the
Truth Jewels, I will trade you those...for THIS.
The Truth Treasure!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1234]
...Or I would, but you haven't any space in your Bag.
Come see me again when you've made some room.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1235]
Ah, excellent. You've got space in your Bag now.
Then without further ado, allow me to trade you
for the Truth Treasure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1236]
Please make some space in your Bag and come see
me again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1237]
Oh, look! A falling star. Wow, it's so pretty...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1238]
Oh, I know! I should make a wish.
Hmm... What to wish for?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1239]
My animals to like me better.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1240]
My friendships to bloom.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1241]
My shipments to earn more.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1242]
I hope my wish comes true...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

One day, a special letter arrived in my mailbox.<wait><page>
It was sent from a person who introduced himself as the
mayor of a certain little town.<wait><page>
The moment I finished reading that letter, I packed up my
things and headed for the train station.<wait><page>
Once there I bought a ticket, a ticket to Mineral Town.
The place where my grandfather had his farm...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1266]
Good day! You are <playername>, I presume?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1267]
I'm Thomas. It is my great honor to preside over
Mineral Town as its mayor.<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1268]
I've been waiting for you. Please, allow me to show you to
the farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1269]
Here it is. This is the land your grandfather left to you.<wait><page>
I'm afraid it's been some time since anyone tended to it,
so it's fallen into a bit of disrepair.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1270]
Do you remember when you came here as a child?
You spent a summer together with your grandfather.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1271]
I'm sorry, <playername>. We've had to cancel our
family vacation this summer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1272]
I just couldn't get the time off for it. There's something
very important that I have to do at work, and I can't
leave.<wait><page>
I'm really sorry, but you'll have to make do without a trip
this year. Things are just too busy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1273]
I promise I'll make it up to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1274]
I'm so sorry, <playername>, but please understand.<wait><page>
We may not get a family vacation, but we have asked
your grandfather to let you stay with him at his farm
this summer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1275]
His farm is wonderful. It's surrounded by nature with all
sorts of places to explore. You can relax and play as much
as you like.<wait><page>
We've already packed your things. All that's left is to go
and have fun!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1276]
Oh ho, there you are, <playername>.
Do you remember me? I'm your grandpa.<wait><page>
There ain't too much to do out here in the sticks, but go
have a nosey around if you like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1277]
I'm afraid I'll be busy most of the day doin' my chores
around the farm, so I won't have much time to play
with you.<wait><page>
There are a few kids around your age in town, though.
I'm sure they'll let you play with them, so go on and
introduce yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1278]
Oh yeah! Someone said the old guy at the farm down the
road was having a visitor from the city.<wait><page>
That must be him. I wonder what he's doing all by himself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1279]
Oh yeah! Someone said the old guy at the farm down the
road was having a visitor from the city.<wait><page>
That must be her. I wonder what she's doing all by
herself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1280]
Do you always play alone? Wow! Me too!<wait><page>
I like this place lots, so I come here all the time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1281]
Hey, why don't you tell me about yourself, and the city,
and stuff. What's it like there?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1282]
Well, <playername>? How'd you like the country life?
Was it fun?<wait><page>
When you get back home, say hello to your mom and dad
for me. And let 'em know I enjoyed havin' you come visit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1283]
Aww, are you going already?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1284]
Oh. I'll miss you. You'll be coming back someday,
though, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1285]
Promise me you'll come back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1286]
It's been 20 years since then. I see you've grown into
a fine young adult.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1287]
Your grandfather loved this little farm dearly, you know.<wait><page>
I'm sure it would make him oh so happy to know that you
had inherited it.<wait><page>
Well? What do you say? Would you like to give farming
a try?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1288]
Yes
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1289]
No
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1290]
I see... Well, the decision is yours, and I won't try to
change your mind. What a shame, though.<wait><page>
If you'll be leaving, there should be another train coming
soon. Goodbye, <playername>...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1291]
Excellent, excellent! Allow me to be the first to welcome
you as a new resident of Mineral Town!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1292]
Now then, as you are the new owner of this farm, do you
not think a new name is in order?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1293]
<myfarm> Farm, hm? It does have a nice ring to it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1294]
Running a farm is not the easiest of jobs in the world,
but if you try hard I'm sure you will do your grandfather
proud!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1295]
Well! I'm sure you must be tired from your long trip here.
Why don't you rest for the remainder of the day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1296]
I must return to my duties as mayor. I bid you good
evening.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1297]
Tomorrow, my new life as a farmer begins!<wait>

Can't we be friends?<wait>

[1315]
This has nothing to do with you. Butt out.<wait>

[1316]
It does, too! I'm--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1317]
I said butt out!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Now then, <playername>. Any last words before
you die?<wait>

[1319]
No.<wait><page>
Because you're not good enough to beat me!<wait>

Ha. Weak. Your power isn't enough to defeat ME.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1323]
Five years later...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1324]
Hey now! This is private property! The owner may be
gone, but trespassers are still not allowed!<wait><page>
Please leave immediately!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1325]
What, you know the elderly gentleman who used to live
here?<wait><page>
I'm afraid he passed away. You didn't know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1326]
Yes, it was half a year ago.<wait><page>
When I was organizing his things afterwards, I found his
will on the bookshelf.<wait><page>
It simply said, "I leave my farm to <playername>."<wait><page>
Thus, until <playername> arrives, I have taken it upon
myself to maintain his property as best I can.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1327]
What? You are <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1328]
I see. If you wouldn't mind, could you please tell me how
you knew the old gentleman?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1329]
Ah, you two were pen pals? I see.<wait><page>
And when the replies stopped coming, you came to visit
and find out why.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1330]
Well, he did mention in his will that he wanted you to
have the farm. You seem like a reliable enough sort.<wait><page>
How about it? Would you like to give farming a try?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1331]
All right, that decides that! This farm now belongs to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1332]
Running a farm is not the easiest of jobs in the world.<wait><page>
But if you try hard, I'm sure you will become a farmer
the old gentleman would be proud of!<wait>

*sigh* We must never let <childname> know of this.
In any case, come on in.<wait>

Happy Birthday, <childname>! You are as medicine
for our souls. Thank you for being in our lives.<wait>

Children grow so quickly. I knew this, of course, but
experiencing it personally is really something else.<wait><page>

Yes, of course. Today is a special day, though, so please
try to finish as quickly as possible.<wait>

Oh, <nickname>. Are you done working?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

You did a good job today, <nickname>.<wait>

[1570]
I have a feast ready for today. Do you remember what
the occasion is?<wait>

[1571]
It's not your birthday! I never thought you'd forget the
most important day of the year.<wait>

[1572]
It's <childname>'s birthday. What is going ON with
you, <nickname>? Don't you love our child?<wait>

MY birthday? You're kidding, right?! I didn't think you'd

Happy Birthday, <childname>! We're so glad to
have you in our lives.<wait>

<childname>'s birthday reminds me of when Popuri
was born.<wait><page>
As a big brother, I wanted to look after my little sister.
Now it's my job to look after <childname>.<wait>

[1577]
You and <childname> are my most precious
treasures.<wait>

Oh, okay. It's a special day, though, so try to hurry up and
finish.<wait>

Yeah? Solid.<wait>

By the way, <nickname>, you remember what day

Hey, c'mon, <nickname>... I know you're busy with
work, but that's kinda messed up.<wait>

Today's <childname>'s birthday. Parents can't
forget that kinda stuff.<wait><page>
Well, whatever.<wait><page>
We'll keep it a secret from <childname> that you
forgot. I'd feel really bad otherwise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1584]
MY birthday?
<wait><page>
Do you know how rude that is both to me and
<childname>?<wait><page>
I thought for sure you'd be looking forward to
<childname>'s birthday too, <nickname>.<wait>

[1585]
Happy Birthday, <childname>! You really stoke the
fires of happiness in our lives.<wait>

I wonder what kinda guy <childname>'s gonna grow
up to be?<wait>

I dunno what I'll do if he inherits Grandpa's stubborn,
moody personality.<wait><page>
Nah, I mean, Grandpa's cool and all, and a passion for
makin' stuff is great, but uh... Yeah.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1588]
I wonder what kinda girl <childname>'s gonna grow
up to be?<wait><page>
I hope we can raise her to be just as cool and loving as
you, <nickname>.<wait>

Oh, right. Well, hurry up and finish, okay? Today's special.<wait>

excited about it.<wait>

Having you there to celebrate it with me is like... Well, it

If you don't remember my birthday, at least remember

birthday, for the record.<wait><page>
Oh, no no no. I didn't mean to snap back like a child.<wait><page>

Maybe you're not the kind of person to care about stuff
like that, but...it's still disappointing.<wait>

[1719]
<childname>'s birthday?! That's the worst possible
answer! Come on, <nickname>...<wait><page>
In other words, you've forgotten not just YOUR birthday,
but <childname>'s, too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1720]
*sigh* And I was so looking forward to it, too.
What a letdown.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1721]
Huh? Our anniversary? How can you say that?
Today's your birthday.<wait>

[1724]
Yeah? Nice. Good job.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1725]
By the way, <nickname>, you remember what day
it is?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1726]
Happy Birthday, <nickname>. Let's keep growin'
together, no matter how old and wrinkly we get.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1727]
Happy Birthday, <nickname>. I'm so glad you were
born and found your way into my life.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1728]
Every day with you is a blast and a half. Let's keep pilin'
on the years together.<wait>

Every day with you is a blast and a half. Let's keep pilin'
on the years together.<wait><page>
And with <childname> too, of course!<wait>

It's kinda embarrassing celebrating your birthday with
just the two of us. It's, like...super intimate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1731]
Whaaat? Uhhh... MY birthday? What kinda joke are you
tellin'? Today's YOUR birthday, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1732]
<childname>'s birthday? Hey, c'mon,
<nickname>. I don't care how busy you are,
that's just...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1733]
...No, wait. We shouldn't be arguing today. I guess I was
the only one lookin' forward to this.<wait><page>
Today's YOUR birthday. That's why I was kickin' around
here. I hoped maybe we could celebrate together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1734]
What kinda answer is that? Did you forget your own
birthday? But I did all this stuff to get ready for it...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1735]
Oh, okay. Try to finish up as fast as you can.
Today's special.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1736]
Morning, <nickname>. Hmmm... You don't look so
hot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1737]
I'm worried you might be sick, so let's have Doctor check
you out. I'll go too, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1738]
All right, let's mosey.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1739]
Mm-hmm... Yes... <playername> isn't sick. You can rest
easy.<wait><page>
But from now on, you should watch what you eat, keep
cool, and refrain from strenuous activities.<wait>

Congratulations, you two. You'll be parents soon.<wait>

Congratulations, Kai and <playername>.<wait>

[1745]
Morning, <nickname>. You seem to be feeling
unwell recently. What's wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1746]
Maybe we should go to the Clinic and have Doctor look
at you. I'm worried, so I'll come too.<wait>

[1747]
Well, let's go.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

W-We're going to have a kid? Being a parent was always
a distant dream. I'm going to be...a dad.<wait><page>
We have to tell Duke and Manna that there's going to be
an addition to our family.<wait><page>
Let's go, <nickname>. Oh, but maybe you should
rest for now? Should we calm down first and then go?<wait><page>
What to do... S-Sorry, I'm so happy and excited that
I'm having trouble keeping my head on straight.<wait>

Perhaps it's just my imagination, but you seem...unwell.<wait><page>
No, on second thought, perhaps you're... Ahem. Will you
come to the Clinic with me so I can examine you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1753]
Off we go, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1754]
I knew it. It's exactly as I surmised.<wait>

You're not sick, <nickname>. You're pregnant.<wait>

Congratulations, Doctor and <playername>.<wait>

We're finally having a child! What a wondrous turn of
events, <nickname>!<wait><page>
No, wait, this is a grave responsibility. I'll be delivering my
child with my own hands.<wait><page>
<nickname>, I want you to ease off of your work
for now and prioritize self-care.<wait><page>
I'll do everything I can to support you.<wait><page>
I'll gather information from the ladies around town
regarding pregnancy and the process of childbirth.<wait><page>
No, no, I'm getting ahead of myself. In any case, let us
both do our best, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1758]
Morning, <nickname>. Do you look a little pale, or is
it just my imagination?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1759]
You seem like you've been under the weather for a few.
Let's go to the Clinic today. I'll go with you.<wait>

Hang in there.<wait>

You must be exhausted, <nickname>. You did well.
Just watching you was amazing. So that's how kids are
born.<wait>

Starting today, I'm a mama! <childname>, my bundle
of joy, I'm so glad you arrived happy and healthy!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1787]
Is she still at it? It's been a while since Doctor and Elly
arrived. The process sure takes some time, huh?<wait><page>
Or maybe something happened to <playername>.
No, no, I can't think like that. Everyone's fine.<wait>

<childname>, huh... Yeah, that's a good name.<wait><page>
I'm sure <childname> will like it too.<wait><page>

You can do this, <nickname>! It's okay.
Everything is going well.<wait>

Try to relax as much as possible. Inhale... Exhale...<wait>

I tried to keep smiling so as not to worry you, but now my
facial muscles feel strained.<wait>

[1800]
Oh, no, I mustn't be like that. I want the first thing our
child sees to be our smiling faces.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1801]
Now, do you have a name in mind, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1802]
<childname>... Yes, that's the perfect name for
our child.<wait><page>
I'm certain that <childname> will like it as well.<wait><page>
I must endeavor to become a man worthy of being
<childname>'s father.<wait>

It's taking too long. Is she not done yet? Doctor and Elly
showed up forever ago. Ugh, I'm so worried.<wait><page>
N-No... Nothing bad's happened. Everything's fine, right,

Wow, babies are TINY. Our kid is so cute.<wait>

Doctor and Elly showed up, though.<wait>

When I woke up, <childname> was standing right by
me. Apparently, the little rascal slipped right out of bed.<wait>

Clearly, textbook medical knowledge is completely
different from experiencing a child's development

off today should do the trick.<wait>

How could this happen? So this is what it means to fail to
practice what you preach.<wait><page>
I thought I was taking good care of my health, so why did
this happen? I'd like to investigate the cause.<wait><page>
No, no... Apologies. It's hard for me to turn off the
analytical part of my brain at times like this.<wait>

Sorry, <childname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1897]
<childname>! <childname>, stay with me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1898]
<nickname>, are you awake?! <childname>
fell out of bed!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1899]
Let's do that.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1900]
How can you say that? A blow to the back of the head
is significant. You mustn't make light of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1901]
We must go to the Clinic and conduct a thorough
examination, just in case.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1902]
Let's go, <childname>. Everything will be fine, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1903]
Yes, I must conduct a thorough examination, just in case.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1904]
Let's go, <childname>. It's okay, Dad's a physician,
so there's nothing to worry about.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1905]
Yes, everything's fine. There's a small scrape, but no
broken bones or anything so grievous.<wait><page>
Phew... Thank goodness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1906]
I'm supposed to be a physician, but seeing
<childname> get hurt sent me into a panic.
How pathetic.<wait><page>
I should have known that children become more
active around this age and that we needed to keep
a watchful eye.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1907]
I'll be more careful from now on.
Sorry, <childname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1908]
<nickname>, wake up! <childname> is...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1909]
What do we do, <nickname>?! When I got up,
<childname> had fallen out of bed!<wait><page>
I have no idea what to do at a time like this!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1910]
How can you say that? <childname> is hurt!
You're supposed to be a parent!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1911]
The Clinic! I'm going to the Clinic! Even if they're closed,
I'll try talking to Doctor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1912]
Come on, <childname>.
You're going to be just fine...okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1913]
R-Right! We have to go the Clinic.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1914]
Let's go, <childname>. You're going to be just fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1915]
Yeah... Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1916]
Th-Thank goodness... My mind went blank and I totally
lost my cool. Pitiful, Rick, pitiful...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1917]
We have to be careful from now on.
Sorry, <childname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1918]
Hey, <nickname>! Wake up!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1919]
When I got up, <childname> had fallen out of bed!<wait><page>
<nickname>, what the heck're we supposed to do?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1920]
How can you say that?! <childname>'s hurt!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1921]
I'm going to the Clinic! Even if it isn't open, I'll friggin' beg
for help if I have to!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1922]
It's okay, <childname>. I'm taking you to the Clinic
right away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1923]
O-Oh yeah! The Clinic!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1924]
Is everything really okay? <childname> was crying
like crazy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1925]
Yeah... Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1926]
Phew, what a relief. I'm so glad it wasn't anything
serious. Sorry, <childname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1927]
We ought to have some privacy here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1928]
Should you truly wish to marry me, I will happily assent.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1929]
Should you truly wish to marry me, I will happily assent.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1930]
Now then, I'm afraid much remains on my plate for the
day. I must excuse myself for now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1931]
...Okay. I marry you. Now go away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1932]
...Okay. I marry you. Now go away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1933]
...Go away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1934]
Here we can talk in private, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1935]
You wish to marry me? Truly? Then marry we shall.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1936]
You wish to marry me? Truly? Then marry we shall.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1937]
Now then, business awaits. I must return to Zack's house.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1938]
I hereby recognize the two of you as a lawfully
wedded couple.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1939]
May we sow the seeds of a blessed life together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1940]
Congratulations, both of you. I wish you the best.<wait>

I shall call you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1949]
What would you prefer I call you, then?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1950]
<nickname>. While I do love you dearly...<wait><page>
My epicurean calling demands that I travel the world,
tasting and critiquing the full breadth of its cuisine.<wait><page>
I'm afraid I may not be able to spend much time with you
in this town.<wait><page>
I will miss you, and I know you will miss me, but I ask for
your patience.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1951]
Thank you, <nickname>.<wait>

Oh, I almost forgot.<wait><page>

I will still come to sell you apples, too, like always.
Okay? Good. <wait><page>
I look forward to spending a long and prosperous life

Your birthday.

No, it is not. *sigh*<wait>

Exactly! I prepared a very special present for you.
I hope it will please your palate.<wait>

[1985]
My thanks.<wait>

Could I ask you to please put down what you are holding?
I would like to give you your present.<wait>

No. Why would today be my birthday? That's like mixing

[2040]
I got a ring!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2041]
Good morning, <nickname>. You have been looking
unwell of late. Did you eat something that didn't agree
with you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2042]
It would be terrible if this were some serious illness.
You ought to see Doctor, just in case.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2043]
Let us collect our things and go.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2044]
Congratulations, both of you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2045]
To think that you were pregnant...! I sup upon the
nourishing joy of imminent parenthood!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2046]
You... Pregnant.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2047]
<playername>, it seems that you are pregnant.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2048]
Good morning, <nickname>. You do not look well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2049]
I do not think it is serious. Stagnant chi, maybe. But one
should consult a doctor just in case, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2050]
Let us get our things and go.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2051]
Congratulations, both of you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2052]
Aiyaaah! We are having a child?! And I...I will be a papa.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2053]
Must we still wait? I hope nothing untoward has
happened. It would be worse than an accident
in the kitchen.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2054]
I see... It seems there is little I can do besides pray that
you and our child will make it through safely.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2055]
Yes... Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2056]
<nickname>, this ordeal will soon be over. I'm sure
it must have been very difficult for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2057]
Now for an important question... What shall we name
our child?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2058]
<childname>? What a lovely name.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2059]
Baby. Born.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2060]
Give it a name.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2061]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2062]
Is our baby born yet? Perhaps now? How about now?
...When will it be born? I dislike waiting.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2063]
You look very worn, yes? Very tired. Just looking at you,
I feel like I may keel over in sympathy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2064]
Yes, yes. Okay. Many thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2065]
<nickname>, the wait is nearly over.
You did very well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2066]
Now, an important question. What will we name
our child?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2067]
<childname>, yes? Ooh. Very auspicious. I think it is
a good name.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2068]
There is something I would like you to see.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2069]
<childname>, would you do it again?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2070]
Daaah.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2071]
<childname> has already learned how to walk.
How quickly the time passes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2072]
I hope <childname> will soon be old enough to enjoy
my exquisite home cooking.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2073]
...Look. Watch.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2074]
Daaah.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2075]
<nickname>! <nickname>! Look here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2076]
Come, come. Come to Papa.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2077]
Well? Very surprising, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2078]
Soon, I will introduce our child to the wide world of
apples. There is much to teach.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2079]
<nickname>! Oh, <nickname>! It is terrible!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2080]
When I awoke this morning, <childname> had fallen
from bed! I think the poor thing is injured!<wait><page>
What do we do now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2081]
You seem to be downplaying the severity of this
situation! What if it is actually something terrible?<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2082]
We're going to the Clinic right away. Even if it is closed,
I will go straight to Doctor! Come, <childname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2083]
O-Oh. Yes, of course! We must take the little one to the
Clinic right away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2084]
Don't worry, <childname>. You will be just fine.
We are taking you to see Doctor now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2085]
Are you certain everything is all right...? The poor thing
cried an awful lot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2086]
Yes... Yes, thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2087]
Thank goodness. We will be very careful from now on.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[2129]
Ah. It's fixed. That's good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2130]
Phew. Good thing they fixed it quick. Sheesh. Didn't need
THAT heart attack today.<wait>

Aha. There we go. They fixed it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2132]
There. The power is back. We may now sleep in peace.<wait>

[2133]
Ah. The light finally returns. Now, early to bed, early to
rise makes us healthy and wealthy, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2134]
Ah. The lights have come back on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2135]
Oh, phew. The lights are back. Geez, that was NOT a cute
surprise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2136]
Ah! And we're back in business. I'm glad it wasn't
anything serious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2137]
Ugh! About time! That wasn't a fun surprise at all.
I don't like surprises that aren't fun.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2138]
There, the lights have come back. Phew. I'm glad it wasn't
anything terrible.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2139]
Geez, now THAT was a surprise. Were we the only ones
affected? I hope my family is okay.<wait>

Aah, the light returns. The spirits must have reconnected
the ley lines slumbering beneath the earth.<wait>

Welcome home, <nickname>.<wait><page>
I have prepared a grand feast for us to enjoy this noon
hour. Please dig in. There is plenty for us both.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2143]
Mm. A delightfully delicious dinner, if I do say so myself.<wait><page>
Now for the dishes. You needn't hover while I wash.
Why don't you step outside for a moment?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2144]
Welcome home, <nickname>.<wait><page>
I have prepared a most sumptuous buffet for our supper.
Please dig in. I made enough for seconds.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2145]
Oh no...! <mydogname> doesn't look so good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2146]
<nickname>, let's take <mydogname> to the
Clinic.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2147]
<mydogname> doesn't look well at all. Is something
wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2148]
I should take the poor thing to the Clinic and have Doctor
take a look.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2149]
There, that ought to do it. <mydogname> is officially
on the mend.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2150]
However...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2151]
<mydogname> was ill because you were neglecting
your responsibility as a pet owner.<wait><page>
I highly recommend you pay more attention to
<mydogname> so this doesn't happen again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2152]
Come to think of it, we haven't played together in a while.
I'm sorry, <mydogname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2153]
<mydogname> looks pretty down. Is the poor thing
not feeling well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2154]
Maybe I should let you inside the house for a while, buddy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2155]
There. You seem a lot happier now.<wait><page>
I haven't paid much attention to you lately, so I hadn't
even noticed you were sad. I'm sorry, <mydogname>.<wait>

Good evening.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2159]
Hope you don't mind if we invade your space for a sec!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2160]
Hey, um, <playername>? We heard you got a Big Bed,
so all us girls decided to come over and check it out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2161]
Yeah! I've always wondered what it would be like to flop
down on one of those huuuge beds.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2162]
And, y'know, if the stars align and all that, we wouldn't
mind turning this into a slumber party...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2163]
I'm sorry we all dropped in on you unannounced like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2164]
It's not every day that all seven of us get together
like this.<wait><page>
Anyway, is it all right if we see your bed?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2165]
Ummm... Boy, this gives new meaning to the
word "cramped."<wait><page>
It IS a really, really big bed, but I guess it isn't big enough
for seven people at once.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2166]
Uh, yeah. I mean, I already fell off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2167]
I, too, have been forsaken by its pillowy embrace.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2168]
It looks like our slumber party idea isn't going to come to
fruition. That's too bad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2169]
Yes. It isn't good for your health to sleep on a drafty
floor, after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2170]
Aww, dang it! I was really looking forward to having a
sleepover. Alas. C'mon, girls. Let's skedaddle.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2171]
Yeah. Sorry for bugging you. Thanks for letting us come
over, though!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2172]
Thank you. Good night.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2173]
Think maybe we can try for sleepover round two some
other time? That'd be cool. G'night!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2174]
Good night. Take care.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2175]
See ya tomorrow! G'niiight!<wait>

[2176]
Until next time. May the moon's energies lull you into
peaceful slumber.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2177]
Well, that was...something. I guess it's time for bed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2178]
Hi, <playername>! Make us something yummy to eat! ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2179]
Please pardon the intrusion.<wait>

[2180]
Yeah. Sorry to drop in on you. But I heard you're a great
cook and I was hoping you could make me something.<wait>

at your table?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2185]
Oh, it would be wonderful if you could ask everyone what
they'd like to have first.<wait>

Definitely. Once you're done with one dish, bring it on
over. No need to wait until it's all done to serve.<wait>

special occasion. Please mind our requests.<wait>

So, yeah! I know this is a lot to put on your plate--heh--
but couldja make something for all of us?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

I am sure you are capable. The voices of the spirits have
spoken to me, and they say you can do anything.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2190]
Coming right up!
<------------------------------------------------------->

It'll be a kitchen nightmare...
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2192]
Really? Aww. Oh well. I guess that's a no.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2193]
We certainly wouldn't want to force you to cook for us,
after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2194]
We'll just take a rain check until the day you DO feel up
to it. How 'bout that?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

This WAS very sudden, after all. I'm sorry about that.
Everyone, we should probably leave <playername>
in peace.<wait>

Yeah, you're right. But maaan, I'm still so huuungry.<wait>

Happy Birthday, <childname>! Thanks so much for

joy every day.<wait>

up to be.<wait><page>

You okay, <nickname>? You must be exhausted

<childname>'s birthday...? Ummm...<wait>

[3255]
First of all, today is MY birthday. I assume you forgot
and just said <childname>'s name on a whim.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3256]
But that's hurtful to <childname> as well.
As family, we need to stay mindful of all
our special days.<wait>

Huh. Okay. Today's kind of a big deal, so try to hurry it up.<wait>

a thorough checkup would be better first.<wait>

To think the day would come when I would look forward
to celebrating my birthday...<wait><page>
Not only that, but the mere act of sitting with you at the
table and chatting is a source of great joy now.<wait><page>
Had I never met you, these are things I would not have
learned or experienced in my life. Ever.<wait><page>
And now we even have <childname> with us, making
our little family of two into a family of three.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3707]
<nickname>, is it that you do not wish to concern
yourself with events that you deem trivial, or...?<wait><page>
I had taken you for the sort to glorify such special
occasions. Perhaps I was mistaken.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3708]
My birthday...? What, have you truly forgotten?
Today is YOUR birthday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3709]
Happy Birthday, <nickname>. Your birth and
presence in this world is a greater miracle than even the
highest art.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3710]
I never knew how joyous it could feel to celebrate a
birthday together with someone special.<wait><page>
I must remember to offer gratitude to your parents.
Without them, you never would have been brought into
this world.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3711]
<childname>'s birthday...? Er, no.
Today is your own birthday.<wait><page>
Did you honestly not remember? Well, you HAVE been
awfully busy of late. I guess it is no surprise it slipped
your mind.<wait><page>
Still, I would like for this to be a special day for us.
I hope you'll remember it in the future.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3712]
Happy Birthday, <nickname>. Your birth and
presence in this world is a greater miracle than even the
highest art.<wait><page>
After all, without you in this world, our little
<childname> would not be here either.<wait>

I look forward to many more years with you.
We have a duty to watch <childname>
grow and mature.<wait>

I can hardly wait to see what sort of living goddess
our little cherub will someday become.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3715]
Good morning, <nickname>. What is wrong?
You look pale.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3716]
You ought to go to the Clinic and see Doctor.
I will accompany you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3717]
Come. Let's be on our way.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3718]
Congratulations, both of you!<wait>

We are...expecting a child? I...I see.<wait><page>
Haha... Parents. We're going to be parents, aren't we?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3720]
The thought has been in the back of my mind since
we were first married...<wait><page>
But now that I am faced with the reality of it,
I find it more difficult than I anticipated to
maintain my composure.<wait><page>
I will do everything in my power to assist you,
<nickname>. You concentrate on taking care
of yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3721]
Incidentally, we ought to tell Gotts the good news as well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3722]
It has been some time since Doctor arrived. Is our child
not ready to enter this world yet, perhaps...?<wait><page>
You look exhausted, yet the hardest part remains ahead
of you.<wait><page>
I hope everything will turn out all right for you,
<nickname>...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3723]
Curses... And there is not a single thing I can do, is there?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3724]
Erm...yes. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3725]
<nickname>... Well done.<wait><page>
You did so well to endure such a painful experience.<wait>

[3726]
So this is what a newborn baby looks like.<wait><page>
As human beings, we all came into this world in the same
way, didn't we? You. Me. Everyone.<wait><page>
Now, what name shall we bestow upon our little angel?
I will leave it to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3727]
<childname>, hm? Brilliant. You've found the
perfect name.<wait><page>
I am certain <childname> will come to love it, too.<wait><page>

But worry not. I have a very good home in mind for
the other.<wait><page>
So, <playername>, which child would you like

The boy!

Um, okay. Then from now on, this child's part of our

Well, our first job as parents is to decide on a name.

Hmmm... Yes, I think I understand what is going on.
This child is in need of parental guidance.<wait>

As such, we will just have to raise this child as our own.
Isn't that right, <nickname>?<wait>

[3758]
And our first task as parents is to decide on a name.
Let's both try to brainstorm one, <nickname>.<wait>

Yeah, okay. We'll raise this baby as part of the family.

Yes, I see. A child in need of parents... It's somewhat
tragic, really.<wait>

[3778]
What a strange twist of fate. We must raise this child as
our own, then. Isn't that right, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3779]
Now then, our first duty as fathers is to conceive a name.<wait>

No problem... We raise.<wait>

...But first, a name.<wait>

A boy name...<wait>

A girl name...<wait>

...Yes.<wait>

Ah, yes. I think I have a grasp of the situation.
This child needs parents.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3792]
Then we will raise this child as our own.
Won't we, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3793]
Now then, let's move on to our first job as fathers.<wait><page>
Yes, we must decide on a name. Let's think of one
together, <nickname>.<wait>

[3794]
Hmmm, what would be good for a boy?<wait>

I have no problem with this. We will raise this child as our
own, yes?<wait>

[3800]
Then we must think of a name.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3801]
A name for a boy...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3802]
A name for a girl...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Yes, that's a perfect name.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3804]
Oh, look. <childname> smiled. That proves it's a
lucky name.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3805]
Good morning, <nickname>. Come. There is
something you must see.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3806]
<childname>, to me. Yes, that's it. Papa is right
here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3807]
Good, good! That was artful, <childname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3808]
Incredible, is it not? Did we surprise you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3809]
I happened to notice the little rascal walking a few
moments prior, then went straight to inform you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3810]
There is something wondrous and mysterious about
children. They are a wellspring of inspiration.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3811]
I don't think I have ever felt this way before.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3812]
We ought to take a family trip to my study someday.
Gotts will surely be as doting as I am.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3813]
What is wrong with me? Inspiration resounds from within
my skull, but my body refuses to move...<wait><page>
Gah... I can barely find the energy to speak. How did this
happen?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3814]
No. Asking "how" is pointless now. I must heal. That takes
priority. Thus, I will now sleep. Good night.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3815]
<nickname>! Wake up!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3816]
<childname> fell from the crib. I think the poor
thing could be injured!<wait><page>
Aah...! My thought process is in a frenzy. I can barely
think straight. What do we do?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3817]
You cannot be serious. What if the worst has happened,
and we simply cannot tell at a glance?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3818]
We are going to the Clinic right now. If Doctor is asleep,
I will wake him!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3819]
Come, <childname>. Let's go see Doctor.
Don't worry. I will take care of everything.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3820]
Yes... Yes, you are right. The Clinic. Let us head there
immediately.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3821]
Aah. I see. Thank goodness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3822]
Yes. Yes, we will.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3823]
<childname>, I am so sorry. We were cautious,
but not sufficiently so. This was our fault.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3824]
My, my! Now isn't THIS unusual? Look over there.
It's Brandon.<wait><page>
Why, I can't remember the last time I saw him come
down into town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3825]
Brandon...? Do you mean that slightly eccentric--
Actually, no. I won't mince words. That HIGHLY strange
hermit?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3826]
I hear he is supposed to be very easy on the eyes and an
excellent artist, but also, well...very, very strange.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3827]
Oh, yes, I've heard the same!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3828]
Yes, that's him! And here he is, gracing our town with his...
unique presence.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3829]
Word is that he's a world-famous artist, you know.<wait><page>
Why, I hear that rich people from aaall over are lining up
to pay top dollar for his works.<wait><page>
In fact, a little birdie told me that his bank account has
a positively mind-boggling number of zeros in it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3830]
Whaaat? Really?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3831]
Where on earth did you hear something like that?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3832]
Aaah, a handsome gentleman staring pensively at the
clouds... Now THAT'S what I call art.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3833]
Handsome and rich is quite the one-two punch,
that's for sure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3834]
Oh, just look at that divine expression of ennui
as he gazes wistfully at the heavens above...<wait><page>
I wonder, do you think he might be interested in taking my
little Adge as a bride?<wait><page>
Yes, she isn't living in town right now, and I can't say
when she'll come back, but that isn't THAT bad... Right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3835]
Worse than bad, I'd say. Hard to date someone you've
never met when they aren't even here.<wait><page>
But anyway, you will not BELIEVE what happened
yesterday. Ugh. I can hardly believe it myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3836]
Ooh! Now THIS I need to hear. Dish!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3837]
Enough. I cannot take another moment of this.<wait><page>
Argh, will they never cease?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3838]
Hm? Am I all right, you ask? Why would I not be?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3839]
I was simply waiting for the sky to present me with my
next duty to fulfill.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3840]
A veritable flood of information will rush down from on
high if you only look up. Organizing it is no small feat.<wait><page>
All the voices in my head clamoring for attention
RIGHT NOW... It takes all of my might simply to put
them in order.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3841]
Was I talking to myself? Ah. I apologize.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3842]
When I take an afternoon stroll, there are times when
inspiration strikes me like a bolt from the blue.<wait><page>
Breathing the fresh air as I walk must energize the font
of inspiration within me until it overflows.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3843]
Now, then. My thoughts have finally been corralled into
some semblance of order, so I will be on my way.
Good day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3844]
So after chewing on the idea a little...
<wait><page>
The idea of a parent deciding who their child will marry
seems ridiculously out-of-date to me. Really, it's just silly.<wait><page>
How could I expect Adge to be happy with anyone
not of her own choosing? In fact, she may not even
want to get married!<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3845]
True. Our children aren't miniature versions of ourselves.
They should be the ones to shape their own futures.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3846]
Oh, definitely. I wholeheartedly agree. But be that as it
may, I'll never turn down a little eye candy...<wait><page>
Hm? Wait a minute...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3847]
Where did Brandon go? He was here just a second ago.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3848]
I guess artists are the impatient sort.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3849]
Oh. <playername>. Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3850]
You wouldn't happen to have seen Officer Harris out and
about, would you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3851]
No? Well, I will wait a little longer, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3852]
You are familiar with his patrol route, yes? He ought
to be passing by here before terribly long.<wait><page>
Thus, I thought to wait here for him. I have something
I'd like to give to him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3853]
Hello, Miss Jennifer. And hello to you, too,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3854]
Hello, Officer Harris. I've been waiting for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3855]
You...have?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3856]
The other day, you were walking down the mountain in
the dark and happened to twist your ankle, did you not?<wait><page>
Gotts was kind enough to inform me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3857]
Goodness. It's amazing how quickly rumors make their
way through town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3858]
But yes, you heard rightly. I am embarrassed
to admit that I tripped over my own two feet
and twisted my ankle.<wait><page>
Fortunately enough, it wasn't all that bad. It had healed
by morning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3859]
Considering you have the protection of the mountain
spirits, I doubt that any truly grave accident would befall
you.<wait><page>
But knowing that you patrol these paths gives me peace
of mind as I cloister myself within my tent.<wait><page>
Thus, I thought I might give you this in gratitude for all
the good you do for our community.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3860]
This is a power stone. It is imbued with positive energies
that will protect you from accident and harm.<wait><page>
This mountain abounds with good energy, and power
stones are plentiful. This one happened to be the
strongest I found.<wait><page>
I hope you will find it to your liking.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3861]
Goodness! A gift? For me?<wait><page>
Thank you very much for your kindness and consideration.
I'm sure this will be most effective.<wait><page>
I gladly accept your thoughtful gift, and will take good
care of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3862]
Now then, I'd best return to my patrol. If you will please
excuse me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3863]
Of course. Good day, Officer Harris.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3864]
You know...? It's hard to shake the feeling that poor
Officer Harris is struggling under an unlucky sign.<wait><page>
Not in terms of health, though. I have little worry that
illness or injury will befall him. No, I speak of romance.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3865]
I hope that power stone will counteract some of his poor
luck and bring him into alignment with an auspicious star.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3866]
I'm sure it was no coincidence you happened to be here,
<playername>. I thought I'd give you a stone as well...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3867]
But I get the impression you don't need it.
I feel a strong energy about you, as if you
have spiritual protection.<wait><page>
You know, I have wondered this for some time now, but...
Who exactly ARE you, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3868]
Good morning, <nickname>.
Tell me, what day is it today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3869]
Your birthday.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3870]
What...? My birthday?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3871]
No, that is utterly wrong. Today is our anniversary.<wait><page>
Aah, I see. You forgot. That is...a bit of a surprise, I admit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

[4024]
Ah. Hello. You must be <playername>, the new
farmer. I see Jeff roped you into this as well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4025]
You see, <playername>, I have a little story I'd like
you to hear.<wait><page>
When Basil stopped by the shop yesterday, we got to
chatting about all sorts of interesting plants.<wait><page>
There was one in particular he mentioned that stuck out
to me: a flower that can convey emotion.<wait><page>
But for all you know about it, Basil, you said you still
haven't seen one for yourself?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4026]
That I haven't. The only records of its existence are in
ancient texts. There is no guarantee it hasn't gone
extinct.<wait><page>
Jeff was rather disappointed. Jeff, I believe you said it
would be handy for expressing your feelings to Sasha?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4027]
AHEM! Basil! Did you really have to mention that?
Now I've gone all red in the face.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4028]
Hahaha. There's nothing wrong with having emotions,
my friend. I'm sure <playername> sympathizes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4029]
Hahaha. There's nothing wrong with having emotions,
my friend. I'm sure <playername> sympathizes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4030]
Er, anyway... We were talking about how it would be nice
to have a way to express our feelings to others directly.<wait><page>
You're getting to be that age too, <playername>.
So we thought you might agree with us on that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4031]
Er, anyway... We were talking about how it would be nice
to have a way to express our feelings to others directly.<wait><page>
You're getting to be that age too, <playername>.
So we thought you might agree with us on that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4032]
And besides, wouldn't it be romantic to hand that special
someone a flower when you tell them how you feel?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4033]
But at the end of the day, that flower is still only a
rumor. No one I know can say for certain if it exists.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4034]
I wonder what it would look like. I'm sure it must be
beautiful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4035]
Ooh! Ooh! I've heard about that flower! But I haven't
seen it either.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4036]
I wanna see it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4037]
Me too, me too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4038]
If we all want to see it, I guess we'll just have to make
one bloom!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4039]
Hi, <playername>! Your farm looks really good!
You must work suuuper hard on it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4040]
Wow! It's been a long, looong time since someone
could see us.<wait><page>
Your name is <playername>, huh? It's nice to
meet you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4041]
Guess what? We came to go shopping!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4042]
H-Hey! What does that look mean? We pay for what we
buy with real money!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4043]
Hey, <playername>. We've heard about that flower.
And we want to try and make one bloom!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4044]
If you want, you can come see too, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4045]
Hm? <playername>, is something the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4046]
Hm? <playername>, is something the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4047]
Ah. Farm work waits for no one, eh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4048]
Well, thank you for listening to my little story.
Keep up the good work on your farm!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4049]
Okay, <playername>. Follow us!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4050]
Gentlesprites, we will now begin the 24th Great Nature
Sprite Experimentation Bonanza!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4051]
Yaaaay! I've been waiting for this!<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4052]
Ready? Here we go!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4053]
Nanaaano... Nanaaano... Na na na NAAA NOOO! ☆<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4054]
Yay! Yay! It worked! It worked!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4055]
Wheeeee!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4056]
We couldn't have done it without you,
<playername>. Your hard work on your
farm has helped bring out the best in us!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4057]
For now, here. Please give one each to Mr. Jeff and
Mr. Basil.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4058]
Now for the important part... The party! We have to
celebrate the great success of our grand experiment!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4059]
<playername>, keep up the good work, okay? All of us
wish you the very best!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4060]
Oh. Why, hello, <playername>. Welcome back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4061]
Oh. Why, hello, <playername>. Welcome back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4062]
Hahaha. Yep, you got us. Jeff and I are still talking about
that flower.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4063]
So, have you come to do some shopping?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4064]
So, have you come to do some shopping?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4065]
<playername>... Th-That flower!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4066]
<playername>... Th-That flower!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4067]
Wait a minute! Don't tell me you actually FOUND the
flower we were talking about?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4068]
You are just...giving this to me? Are you sure?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4069]
You are just...giving this to me? Are you sure?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4070]
Now THIS is a wonderful present! See, I like to dabble in
painting, and I think I will make this flower my next motif!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4071]
Ah, before I forget. <playername>, since you
discovered this flower, would you like to give it a name?<wait><page>
It might have a formal name already, but that would take
digging to find. Why not give it something more palatable?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[4073]
The "Sunsweet" flower, hm? All right.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4074]
I am going to begin my analysis of this specimen right
now. I'll let you know what I find.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4075]
Good morning, <playername>. Could I bother you to
take a look at this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4076]
Good morning, <playername>. Could I bother you to
take a look at this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4077]
It's a Preserved Flower. I showed the Sunsweet Flower
you gave me to a friend, and he made this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4078]
To commemorate the creation of a brand-new product,
I thought I would give you the very first one.<wait><page>
Had you not found that flower, we never would have
thought to make something like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4079]
When you finally find that special someone, wouldn't it be
wonderful to give this to them when you confess?<wait><page>
Just a thought. Well then, I'll be on my way.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4080]
Uh-oh. It looks like your Bag can't hold any more tools.<wait><page>
Spare tools go in your Tool Box, so I'll just slip this in
there with them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4081]
Good morning, <playername>! I've done it!
I've finally done it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4082]
Good morning, <playername>! I've done it!
I've finally done it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4083]
Oh, er, sorry. Let me start from the beginning. I looked
into that flower you found, and it is indeed a new species.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4084]
It gets better, too--just a little while ago, I finally
succeeded in making seeds from it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4085]
Since I was going to let you know of my discovery
anyway, I thought I'd bring you some Sunsweet Flower
Seeds, too.<wait><page>
I hope you will plant them and help spread this new
flower far and wide.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4086]
Thank you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4087]
Like all seeds, these can only be grown in a certain
season. The Sunsweet Flower thrives in autumn.
Understood?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4088]
Phew, it's been so long since I've felt this fired up about
my research. Plants are so fascinating!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4089]
And it's all thanks to you, <playername>. I hope we
can get together and talk botany again sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4090]
And it's all thanks to you, <playername>. I hope we
can get together and talk botany again sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4091]
Hm? It looks like your Bag is full. There's no space for the
seeds there, so I'll just put them in your Tool Box.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4092]
Ah! Hi, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4093]
Guess what? The flower we made bloom will now grow
here during this season aaall by itself!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4094]
I just found this out myself. Isn't that so mysterious?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4095]
I'm going to tell all the other Sprites about it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4096]
Bye-bye!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4097]
<playername>, good morning! You always seem super-
duper happy to be married.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[4136]
Oh? You've gathered all seven rings. Congratulations!
Not that I have a gift for you at all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4137]
Oh? Your Bag is full. I can't give you your present.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4138]
Huh? Guess your Bag's full. I wanna give you a present,
sooo...<wait>

I wanted to give you a present, but...your Bag's full,

I got a present for you, but it seems your Bag is full.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4142]
I wanna give you a present, so couldja get some junk out
of your Bag?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Oh... Your Bag is full. I want to give you a present.

like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4147]
I want you to take my present, but your Bag's full.<wait>

[4148]
I can't give you a present if your Bag's full. Clear it out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4149]
I'd like to give you a present, so could you perhaps free up
some space in your Bag?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4150]
I can't give you a present if your Bag's full.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Hm? It appears your Bag is full. That means I can't give
you my present.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

With my power, I can let you warp instantly to
a convenient spot in the mines you've already
reached!<wait><page>
Hm? Which floor is good, you ask?<wait><page>
Well, the next time you enter either of the two mines,
you'll be able to choose!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4172]
...Or you would have, but you haven't even reached
floor 50 of a mine yet!<wait><page>
Toooo bad! You're going to have to dig deeper, I say!
And once you get to the 50th floor, you'll be able to warp!<wait>

repay them.<wait><page>
It's just...I never know what to say to them.<wait>

[4179]
They'd be happy to hear that.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4180]
That's kinda lame.

Oh no, you think so?!<wait>

You seem rather unoccupied. I envy that!

looking for work.<wait><page>
Well, how would you like to work for us? Sounds like a

town and everything...<wait>
