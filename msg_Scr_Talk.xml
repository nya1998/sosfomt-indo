Hi. I'm Rick. I live in town with my mom

[0002]
Wow, thanks! That's my <nickname>.<wait><page>
I knew you'd remember my birthday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0003]
Oh, wow! Thanks! Today's my birthday, even!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0004]
Wow, thanks! This is my most favorite food, too.<wait><page>
You're so considerate, <nickname>. Boy, now I'm
going to have to get something for you. Hmm...what would
be good?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0005]
Thanks! I really like everything egg and egg-adjacent, and
not just because I grew up on a chicken farm.<wait><page>
This is a particular favorite of mine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0006]
Ooh! Thanks. You know me so well, <nickname>.<wait><page>
I certainly picked the right girl to marry, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Ooh! Thanks. It's so nice of you to get a present for me,
<playername>.<wait>

[0009]
Ooh! Thanks. It's so nice of you to get a present for me,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0010]
Ooh! Thanks, <nickname>. Even now that we're
married, you're still as sweet as ever. I appreciate the
present.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0011]
Ooh! Thanks, <nickname>. Even now that we're
married, you're still as sweet as ever. I appreciate the
present.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0012]
Ooh, is this for me? Great! I can really use this. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0013]
Ooh, is this for me? Thanks, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0014]
Ooh, is this for me? Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0015]
Er... Don't get me wrong, I'm always grateful for the
thought behind any present you give me,
<nickname>...<wait><page>
But, uh, I'd appreciate it if you picked something else
next time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0016]
Um...thanks? I guess?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0017]
WHAT THE FLAP?! EW! Not that! Of all things,
not that! What the heck were you thinking,
<nickname>?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0018]
EGG-SCUSE ME?! EW! Are you really giving this to me?!
What the heck were you thinking?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0019]
They're so dang cute. I swear, I get the warm fuzzies
every time I see them. Don't you, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0020]
Man, they're SO cute!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0021]
<nickname>, don't take that anywhere near our
coop, please and thanks. You'll send the chickens into
a frenzy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0022]
I try to keep all other animals out of our chicken coop.
The chickens panic and stress out if they get too close.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0023]
Oh, that's pretty. If you don't want it, <nickname>,
I'll give it to Mom.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0024]
Oh, that's pretty. I don't really need it myself, but I bet
Mom would love it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0025]
Is that yours, <nickname>? Neat!<wait><page>
I wouldn't use it myself. Maybe I should give it to Mom?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0026]
Huh? This is for me? To be honest, I don't have much use
for it.<wait><page>
I wonder if Mom would like it...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0027]
Sorry, I tend not to wear this sort of thing. Haven't I told
you that before?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0028]
Sorry, I tend not to wear this sort of thing. Just FYI for
next time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0029]
Uh...thanks, <nickname>. But you DO remember
today's the day for guys to give presents to girls, right...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0030]
Uh...thanks, <nickname>. I guess this IS the right
occasion to be handing out presents.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0031]
Uh...thanks. But you DO remember that today's supposed
to be the girls' turn to receive presents, right...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0032]
You're sure it's okay for me to have this? Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0033]
Wow. Even now that we're married, you still
remembered to get me a Valentine's Day present.
Thanks, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0034]

Thanks, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0035]
Ooh, thanks!<wait><page>
I didn't get you anything for White Day, yet you still got
something for me. I almost feel guilty accepting it.
Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0036]
Hm? Oh, you remembered that I got you something for
White Day and wanted to give me something in return?<wait><page>
Thanks! That's so kind of you.<wait>

Wow, you're getting married? Congrats! I bet it'll be a
big help having another person around your farm, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0046]
Ah. A Preserved Flower. For me, I assume?<wait><page>
Um... I'm really flattered you feel that way, but I'm afraid
we aren't quite on the same page.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0047]
Um... I'm flattered you'd offer, really, but I think it's a bit
too soon for us. Sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Hey, this is just the latest scuttlebutt, but a farm over in
Forgotten Valley is supposed to have a lot of animals.<wait><page>

My family will be throwing a little party to mark the
occasion. You can come too, if you like.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0053]
The party don't start till I walk in!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0054]
Sorry. I can't make it.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0055]
So you'll come? Cool! Plan to arrive at my place by
6:00 PM, then. We'll be waiting for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0056]
Really? Aw, that's too bad. I guess you DO have all your
farm work to think of. Oh well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0057]
We'll be throwing a little party for Starlight Night
tomorrow. Be sure you're home by 6:00 PM, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0058]
Man, to think our baby is right here in your tummy,
turning into more of a little person every single day.<wait><page>
It's crucial for you to take care of yourself now. Promise
me you won't stay out late and get a chill, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0059]
Do you have morning sickness at all? I hear that's
supposed to be rough. <wait><page>
As a guy, I can't even begin to imagine how uncomfortable
that must be. I'm on call if you need anything, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0060]
You're looking a lot better now.
Is the baby moving around at all?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0061]
If you feel something, let me know, okay? I wonder if
we're in for a son or a daughter...<wait><page>
If it's a girl, I think you should be the one to name her,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0062]
How are you feeling? You aren't too tired or anything,
are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0063]
I hear it's good for you to get a little bit of exercise
during pregnancy. Man, I can't wait to be a dad!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0064]
The baby is supposed to arrive tomorrow, right?
I've asked Elly and Doctor to come over,
just in case.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0065]
I'll spend all day at home with you tomorrow, okay?
And you should probably get to sleep early tonight, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0066]
Eyelids...heavy... Sheesh. I guess sleepless nights are just
part and parcel of raising an infant, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0067]
Eesh. Our little one doesn't sleep for more than
a few hours at a time, so we can't either.
Are you holding up okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0068]
Our baby really has my eyes, wouldn't you say? I think
somebody is going to grow up to look a lot like Papa!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0069]
Our baby's eyes really resemble mine, huh? I hope our
little one will grow up to take after the both of us!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0070]
I just can't take my eyes off of our baby. So precious.
I think we've got a little weight gain going on, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0071]
Agh, so cute! It's really fun to watch a child grow. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0072]
I wonder what we should do tomorrow?
Geez, even at work, I can't stop thinking about our baby.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0073]
<nickname>, you aren't too tired, are you?
Are you feeling okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0074]
I imagine it's hard to be on your feet. I'm tired just
watching you! Why don't you rest and let me handle
things?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0075]
It feels like babies grow so quickly. Doesn't it seem that
way to you too?<wait><page>
I wonder what sort of person <childname> will
grow up to be. The anticipation is killing me.
Okay, bad word choice...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0076]
Oh, but aren't girls supposed to be more rebellious
towards their dads? Oof, I hope that never happens
with ours...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0077]
Sorry. For some reason, I'm just not in the mood
to chat today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0078]
Could you give me some space, please?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0079]
Good morning, <nickname>. Been really busy
as of late?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0080]
Hey, um... I know this will probably seem like it's coming
out of nowhere, but...I miss you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0081]
Is it me, or have we not talked all that much lately?
Maybe...maybe it IS just me. I hope.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0082]
If you don't set aside more time for us to spend together
as a couple, then I'm not sure I know why we're still
married.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0084]
Good morning. Did you sleep well? You aren't stressing
yourself out too much, are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0085]
I don't mean to make assumptions about what you can
and can't handle, but I'm worried for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0086]
How have you been feeling? You aren't overworking
yourself, I hope?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0087]
Try not to work too much after midnight, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0088]
Morning, <nickname>. Let's both hit today with
everything we've got. Come see me over at the chicken
farm, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0089]
<nickname>, you doing okay on your own? Just say
the word if you need anything. Remember, you aren't
alone anymore. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0090]
So, how was your day? It's important for a couple to have
good communication, y'know. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0091]

There's no rush, though. We're going to be together for
a long, looong time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0093]
Morning, <nickname>. ∀ Let's both give it our best
out there, okay? It's a new day full of exciting potential.<wait>

do anything. I feel so lucky to be your husband. ∀<wait>

How is the farm doing? Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0098]
I'm probably stating the obvious, but I think you're most in
your element with your sleeves rolled up on the farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0099]
Oh, hey, <nickname>. Here to do some shopping?<wait><page>
Remember, you're driving for two right now.
Take it easy, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0100]
What's that?<wait><page>
You think I'm taking this whole fatherhood thing a little
too seriously? Heh. I'll take that as a compliment.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0101]
Hey, <nickname>. What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0102]
Oh, uh, I was just wondering if anything was going on with
<childname>, so I came to check. Can Papa have a
little visit?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0103]
Oh, uh... Hey, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0104]
Could you give me a little breathing room for a minute?
I'm thinking about something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0105]
Oh. Hey, <nickname>. Something up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0106]
If you don't need me for anything, could you leave me
alone, please?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0107]
Hey, what's up? Come to check on the chickens?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0108]
Or are you here to check up on me instead? I'm doing just
fine. Everything's peachy keen.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0109]
Hey, <nickname>. How's the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0110]
It's such a relief knowing home is just a short jaunt away.
If anything happens, I can run straight there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0111]
Oh, hey, <nickname>. So you came to see me, huh?
Aww. Make yourself at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0112]
Man, uh, it still makes my cheeks a little flushed, meeting
like this somewhere other than home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0113]
Hey, how's it going? Everything's great on my end.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0114]
Apparently, Mom has been waiting ages for me and
Karen to get married, and for her to move in with us.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0115]
Hey, <playername>. How's it going?
Things are great on my end.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0116]
Hey, <playername>. How's it going?

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0117]
Man, marriage is SO worth it. It has been such a relief to
have Karen in my corner.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0118]
Hey. Don't forget to drop by my store sometimes, too.
My chickens lay the best eggs around.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0119]
My childhood friend works over at the General Store.
Her name's Karen. She's a really nice gal.<wait><page>
Have you met her yet?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0120]
Phew! Feeding all these chickens day in and day out
is a lot of work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0121]
It'd be so much easier if Dad came back home to help.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0122]
Karen's a heck of a friend. We can talk to each other
about anything. I mean, we've been together since we
were kids.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0123]
Back then, I pretty much played with her and her alone.<wait><page>
We had so much fun goofing around together...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0124]
Y'know, recently, I've started to realize just how
important Karen really is to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0125]
It's still too embarrassing to tell her that, though.
Promise me you'll keep this a secret! Please?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0126]
It's still too embarrassing to tell her that, though.
Promise me you'll keep this a secret! Please?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0127]
It's weird. For some reason, Karen has been awfully quiet
as of late. She's usually on my case about SOMETHING...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0128]
No one understands me quite like Karen does. Not even
Popuri, if I'm being honest.<wait><page>
She's my sister, sure, but she's always snippy with me,
telling me to shut up or leave her alone. It's a shame.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0129]
Oh, hey, <playername>. What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0130]
Oh, hey, <playername>. What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0131]
We really are getting married, aren't we? You and me.
Married. ∀<wait><page>
You're going to wear a wedding dress and everything.
I can't wait to see it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0132]
We really are getting married, aren't we? You and me.
Married. ∀<wait><page>
You're going to wear a nice tuxedo and everything.
I can't wait to see it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0133]
Hey. How's the farm doing? It's business as usual over
here. Our chickens are happy and thriving.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0134]
It takes a lot of strength to start from nothing and make
it into something, I bet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0135]
Hey, how's it going? Getting used to all your farm chores?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0136]
Let me know if you need anything. We're neighbors now,
after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0137]
Hi, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0138]
Hi, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0139]
We grind our chickens' feed with our water mill.
I'm pretty sure you ought to have one on your farm,
too, <playername>.<wait>

[0141]
Chickens may look the same at a glance, but if you look
closely, you'll start noticing all their little differences.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0142]
...You still can't tell? Huh. I guess it's harder for some
people than others. I'll teach you a trick or two later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0143]
...You still can't tell? Huh. You know how some people have
face blindness? Maybe that's you, but with chickens.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0144]
Man, caring for a life is a lot of hard work and
responsibility. I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir,

each one of them and their adorable quirks. It's never
boring.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0148]

[0156]
It's funny. Without Karen around, I feel like I'm
floundering. I'd better head home as soon as I can.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0157]
Karen's an only child, so I bet Jeff gets really lonely not
having her around the house anymore.<wait><page>
Not that Sasha doesn't look for any excuse she can to
come visit us, either.<wait>

y'know. I'm not THAT much of an old man at heart.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0162]
Ugh, it's summer again. That flake Kai is going to drift in
and start making moves on Popuri again, I just know it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0163]
Honestly, it's half Popuri's fault too! She encourages him.<wait><page>
She's so naïve that she has no clue just how
untrustworthy that flake is.<wait><page>
Tell her, <playername>. She'll never listen to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0164]
Popuri only comes home in the summer these days. I never
thought I'd get this anxious for a season to come.<wait>

Mom is really happy that Popuri's home for a visit.<wait><page>
I just wish she would stay home year-round.<wait>

[0166]
Hey. Popuri seems really happy with her new life. She
sends letters every week and comes to visit over the
summer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0167]
Of course, when she writes, she drones on and on about
herself and that flake Kai.<wait><page>
And he's ALWAYS with her when she visits in summer.
Can't either of them spare a thought for poor ol' Rick?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0168]
I like pretty much everyone in town except for Kai.
I can't stand that no-good bum.<wait><page>
He drifts in like low tide in the summer, turns the town
on its head, and then disappears whenever he pleases.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0169]
Mom and Popuri don't have so much as a single bad thing
to say about Kai...<wait><page>
But I'm not surprised, seeing how women seem to fawn
all over him. That's another thing I don't like about him.<wait>

[0173]
On days like this, I always feel like even the chickens
would tell me to take the day off if they could talk.<wait><page>
I mean, they're all hunkered down in their coop, quietly
resting. Nobody's trying to sneak out and run away.<wait>

[0174]
Hey. What brings you out at a time like this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Sure you shouldn't call it a day and head home?<wait><page>

need to get some rest when you have the chance.<wait>

Oh, hey, <playername>. How's it going? Me?

Oh, hi, <playername>. I guess you've got a lot to do
around the farm like always, huh?<wait>

Are you SURE you should be hanging out around here?
Isn't there somebody waiting for you at home?<wait>

Still the same ol', same ol'?<wait>

Oh, that's right! You haven't met my dad yet,
have you, <playername>?<wait><page>
I wonder what Dad would think of you...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0349]
Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0350]
What do you want?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0351]
Is farming fun to you? See, um...
I actually think it's kinda boring.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0352]
Oh, that's a secret, though. Okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0353]
<playername>, you aren't like my brother at all.
You're actually super nice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0354]
Rick just doesn't seem to get that I'm a grown-up now.
He never leaves me alone... I'll tell you more later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0355]
Hey, <playername>? What was the town you used
to live in like?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0356]
I want to go traveling and visit aaall kinds of places.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0357]
Y'know, <playername>, you're super mature
and impressive. I mean, you can run that whole farm
all by yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0358]
Rick was talking to me about how amazing you are.
I really look up to you too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0359]
<playername>, what do you think of me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0360]
Everyone here treats me like I'm still a little child.
Do YOU think I'm still a kid too?<wait>

[0361]
Awww! <playername>!<wait><page>
Wow... You actually treat me like I'm a real grown-up.
Thanks.<wait>

I wonder what the point of the Church is.
Like, what's it supposed to be for?<wait><page>
Whenever I ask Father Carter about it, he only says,
"Good question."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0367]
The Church was built when I was still just a little girl.<wait><page>
I'd always ask Rick to take me here to see it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0368]
Right now, Mom is watching the store and Rick is
feeding the chickens.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0369]
I'm sure Dad had a lot of faith in Rick. I mean, he didn't
teach ME how to do any of the chores the way he
taught Rick.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0370]
I have a thing for beaches and the ocean in general,
but I think that out of all of them, I like Mineral Beach
the best.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0371]
Kai's dad owns restaurants in lots of towns all over.<wait><page>
I betcha you didn't know that, huh?
I didn't for the longest time either.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0372]
Summer is THE best season around!
I mean, isn't the ocean prettiest under the bright
summer sun?<wait>

Have you ever eaten at the Beach Cafe? The menu
has all kinds of food you can't find growing here
in Mineral Town.<wait>

The Spring Derby's coming up. Hmm, I've still gotta figure

Whenever the Fetch Fest comes around, Kai just lights
up! He just loves, loves, LOVES the ocean!<wait>

The Fetch Fest is tooomorrow! I'm super excited...but I've
gotta make sure I keep the sunburn to a minimum!<wait>

Hey, <playername>! Are you entering a chicken in

We're pretty tied up with all the preparations for
tomorrow's Cluck-Cluck Clash.<wait>

The Moo-Moo Festival is coming up! I can't wait to see
all the cute cows again this year!<wait>

[0381]
The prize-winning cow from the Moo-Moo Festival must
have super tasty milk, I'll bet!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0382]
The Fireworks Festival is tomorrow! I don't wanna be
even a second late for it!<wait>

[0383]
It's Moonlight Night tomorrow. Staring at the moon
might sound kinda boring at first, but it's much more fun
than it sounds, promise!<wait>

You know a lady never tells. ♪<wait>

My, my! Why, thank you! My husband used to bring this to
me a lot in our younger days.<wait>

what sorts of things his mother likes?<wait>

Oh, dear. I'm afraid I don't like this...<wait>

Some years ago, my husband decided he was going to get
me perfume for my birthday. He went to town to buy
some...<wait><page>
...but by the time he finally came back home again,
it was a whole year later on my next birthday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0397]
Ooh, I have a lovely idea. Why don't I teach you the recipe
for Tamagoyaki? It's really quite simple!<wait><page>
First, you drizzle a little Oil in your Frying Pan.
Then, you crack the Egg in and cook it... That's it!<wait><page>
They say you shouldn't eat more than one egg a day, but
I'm inclined to believe otherwise.<wait><page>
Eggs are tasty and packed full of nutrition, so get in that
kitchen and cook them up to your heart's content!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0398]
Oh, what a lovely Blue Feather. Why, I still remember
the day my husband gave me one.<wait><page>
He said he was going to find one for me instead
of buying it at a store... It was quite some time
before he came back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0399]
Do you remember the letter my husband sent to me
before? Well, he followed it up with another one.<wait><page>
He said he was going to try to write to me more often.
I wonder where he is and what he's doing...<wait>

Rumor says that in Forgotten Valley, they have little
rat-like creatures that people keep as pets.<wait><page>
Goodness, what were they called again? Ah, yes.
"Chihuahuas."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0401]
Everyone I've heard talk about them says they're cute
and friendly animals. I'd love to see one someday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0402]
I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm afraid that whenever I have to
rest, we close the store.<wait><page>
After all, there's no telling if either of my children will be
home. I'm the only one who can mind the register.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0403]
I haven't the energy to help take care of the chickens, so
I must make up for it by doing what I can in the store.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0404]
I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm afraid we're closed today.<wait><page>
You see, I'm getting ready to go to my appointment at the
Clinic. I truly do apologize for the inconvenience.<wait>

He's grown into such a responsible and serious young man.
He had little choice, what with my condition...<wait>

When we got married and went on our honeymoon,
my husband bought me two chickens as a present.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0417]
Those chickens laid a huge number of eggs,
all of which hatched into more chickens than
we knew what to do with.<wait><page>
Soon, we had so many that we decided we might as well
start our own chicken farm.<wait>

Oh my, what a coincidence! Hello, sweetie! And how is
<childname> doing, hm?<wait>

<childname> was born. My spirits are higher these

Medicine isn't very cheap, you know.

foot the bill.<wait><page>
Doctor always says I don't have to pay for my checkups,

Animals are the best.<wait><page>
There was a mountain by the town I used to live in too.
I liked going there to catch bugs and watch the animals.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0518]
Whoa whoa whoa!
Keep that away from me.
You're not scared, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0519]
Whoa whoa whoa!
Keep that away from me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0520]
This photo! Where did you find it?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0521]
Oh... Huh. So you told Ran and the others.<wait><page>
The people in this picture are my mother and little sister.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0522]
I...hated the town where I grew up, so I left. I ran away
and abandoned my mother and sister.<wait><page>
When I came back, they were gone. My mother had
passed away, and my sister had disappeared.<wait><page>
It felt like I'd completely lost myself...<wait><page>
So I wandered around on my own with nowhere to go
until I arrived here.<wait><page>
It's...a lot like my hometown.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0523]
Ah! Sorry! I'm sure you don't want to hear about all that.<wait><page>
Thank you...for finding this picture.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0524]
Wow, that's some beautiful jewelry.
You're giving it to me?<wait><page>
Thanks! But I think it would look better on you,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0525]
Wow, that's some beautiful jewelry.
You're giving it to me?<wait><page>
I don't think I have much use for it, you know.
But thanks anyway!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0526]
Wow, that's some beautiful jewelry.
You're giving it to me? Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0527]
I think a gift like this is kind of wasted on me, but...thanks.
I'll take it.<wait><page>
I feel like you'd get more use out of it than I would,
though, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0528]
For me? Thanks. I'll take it.<wait><page>
It may come in handy sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0529]
Wow... Thanks. I never thought I'd get something like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0530]
Wow, that sure smells nice.
You're giving it to me?<wait><page>
Thanks. I think you'd enjoy it more than I would, though,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0531]
Wow. You're giving it to me?
Huh. I wonder if I can pull it off.
Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0532]
Wow, that's something you don't see every day.
And you're giving it to me?<wait><page>
Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0533]
Thanks, <nickname>.<wait><page>
But this is the day I'm supposed to give YOU something.
Did you mark the date down wrong on your calendar?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0534]
Thanks. But today's when guys are supposed to be giving
out presents, and--<wait><page>
Wait... Did I mess this up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0535]
Oh... What do I...?
Um... Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0536]
Thanks. You didn't have to go to all the trouble of making
that just for me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0537]
Huh? What's this? Valentine's Day?
You're giving that to me? Th-Thanks.<wait><page>
I don't think I gave you anything for White Day. S-Sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0538]
Thanks. It's kind of embarrassing to get something
in return.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0539]
Hey, <playername>. Now that's something you don't
see every day.<wait><page>
Is that a Preserved Flower?
Y-Yeah...of course I know what it means.
We should go somewhere else, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0540]
Hey, <playername>. Now that's something you don't
see every day.<wait><page>
Is that a Preserved Flower?
Y-Yeah...of course I know what it means.
We should go somewhere else, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0541]
Uh... That's a Preserved Flower, isn't it? Probably not the
sort of thing you should be showing people so casually...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0542]
A-Ah!
Um, hey, I feel kind of exposed right here, so...uh...<wait><page>
Let's go to your place, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0543]
A-Ah!
Um, hey, I feel kind of exposed right here, so...uh...<wait><page>
Let's go to your place, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0544]
Oh, a Blue Feather! Now that I think about it, people use
those for proposals back in my hometown too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0545]
Um... How to put this?
I'm glad you feel that way, but, uh... Sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0546]
What's the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0547]
Mention part-time job
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0548]
Remain pointedly silent
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0549]
Huh? A part-time job at the Vineyard?
Hmm, I AM almost out of money.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0550]
Okay. I'll go check it out tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0551]
<playername>, tomorrow is Starlight Night.<wait><page>
I'm usually alone whenever the holiday rolls around,
so I thought maybe we could throw a party together.<wait><page>
Is it all right if we have it at your place?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0553]
Fantastic. Then come to the Cellar tomorrow
at 6:00 PM.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0554]
Fantastic. Then come to the Inn tomorrow at 6:00 PM.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0555]
No, no, don't worry about it. You can't help it if you
already have other plans. I get it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0556]
<nickname>, tomorrow is Starlight Night.
Please be home around 6:00 PM.
I can't wait to celebrate together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0557]
We've finally started to build our own little family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0558]
I swear I just about fainted when I heard that you're
carrying a baby, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0559]
We're parents now, <nickname>.
We'd better get it together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0560]
We're both dads now, <nickname>.
We'd better get it together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0561]
How are you feeling? What's it like having a baby
inside you?<wait><page>
It's pretty much impossible for me to conceptualize,
because, well...you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0562]
Your belly is getting bigger.
Is pregnancy as exhausting as it looks?<wait><page>
I'll take care of grabbing anything you need from
the top shelf, so you just rest, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0563]
Huh? The baby just kicked?
Let me feel it too!
The big day is around the corner, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0564]
I'm guessing that the baby could be born as soon as
tomorrow. We should have Doctor come over.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0565]
Why don't you take it easy today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0566]
I'm a little scared to hold <childname>. I swear I've
had nightmares about not being able to support the
baby's neck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0567]
Raising kids is hard. When my sister was born, I was too
scared to hold her either. I should've just done it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0568]
<childname> is getting bigger.
The human body truly is amazing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0569]
This is the first time since becoming an adult that
I've understood how my mom must've felt about
being a parent.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0570]
<childname> is really becoming more and more
of a little person every day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0571]
Everything our baby does is just so adorable. I never
thought I would be such a doting dad, but here we are.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0572]
Don't you think <childname> has sturdy standing
posture? I guess I must've had a knack for it growing up,
too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0573]
Now that we have <childname>, I find myself
having gratitude for even the most mundane things.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0574]
<childname> was trying to say something.<wait><page>
I want to talk back, but I'm not exactly fluent in baby.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0575]
You seem to understand perfectly, <nickname>.
I'm a little jealous.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0576]
...We haven't talked much recently.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0577]
You think it's MY fault?<wait><page>
What kind of husband and wife are we if we can't even
communicate on a basic level?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0578]
You think it's MY fault?<wait><page>
What kind of husbands are we if we can't even
communicate on a basic level?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0579]
...Morning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0580]
You're busy again today? Work is all well and good, but
don't forget to make some time for your husband, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0581]
Welcome back.
Are you done working yet?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0582]
That was unkind of me.
I'm sorry...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0583]
Morning, <nickname>.
How's the farm going?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0584]
I'm doing well. You should come visit the Vineyard
once in a while.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0585]
Work isn't all fun and games.
I'm sure you, of all people, know that well,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0586]
I'm not talking about myself. Something just struck me
while I was watching you work, <nickname>.<wait><page>
I couldn't help but think to myself that I still have a long
way to go.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0587]
Morning. Is work going well?
Don't hurt yourself out there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0588]
Farm work has to be at least a little dangerous from
time to time, yeah?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0589]
Welcome home, <nickname>.
Were you out working this late?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0590]
I'm glad you're working hard,
but take it easy sometimes.
I'm worried about you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0591]
Good morning, <nickname>! ∀
How're you feeling today?
I'm great.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0592]
Good morning, <nickname>! ∀
How're you feeling today?
I'm great.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0593]
It's nice to have someone to greet you in the morning and
welcome you back at night.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0594]
My heart's at peace when I'm with you,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0595]
There really is nothing like being surrounded by family.
I'm so glad I married you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0596]
There really is nothing like being surrounded by family.
I'm so glad I married you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0597]
<nickname>! Listen, your body is in no shape to be
running around town like this. You do know that, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0598]
I'm glad you came to see me,
but please don't push yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0599]
Hey, <nickname>. You came to see me?
How's <childname> doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0600]
Whenever I close my eyes, I can't help but picture
<childname>'s little face.<wait><page>
Like, is <childname> sleeping right now? Eating?
Crying? I'm obsessed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0601]
What is it?
Is something wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0602]
If you don't need me for anything,
then please don't talk to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0603]
Oh, <nickname>...
What's wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0604]
Huh? Me? ...It's nothing.
I just have something on my mind.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0605]
Hey, <nickname>. Do you have business nearby?
It's weird to run into each other in town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0606]
I'm working hard at the Vineyard.
By the way, Manna's always saying that you should come
see her more often.<wait><page>
Apparently, she has a lot she wants to talk
with you about.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0607]
Oh, <nickname>.
What're you doing here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0608]
You came to see me? Wow, that's really nice of you!
Makes me happy, honestly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0609]
Huh? <nickname>?
What's wrong?
Do you need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0610]
Don't go back to the Inn by mistake? Haha. Don't worry.
I promise I'll come home to you tonight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0611]
Whenever I'm feeling worn down, Ran is always there
with refreshments. I really look forward to her stopping
by!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0612]
I'm working hard!
I have to think positively!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0613]
Hey, <playername>.
This job in the Vineyard really suits me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0614]
Hey, <playername>.
This job in the Vineyard really suits me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0615]
Manna and Duke are nice people, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0616]
I'm really grateful to Ran. From the moment we met,
she's treated me like a friend. Like...someone who
belongs here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0617]
Up until now, I've thought of Ran as something of a little
sister, but I'm beginning to see her in a new light.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0618]
Oh, <playername>.
What's wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0619]
Oh, <playername>.
What's wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0620]
Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd be getting
married so soon. It still doesn't feel real.<wait><page>
Seeing you in a wedding dress...<wait><page>
You're going to be the most beautiful woman in the
whole world. I can't wait.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0621]

married so soon. It still doesn't feel real.<wait><page>
Seeing you in a tuxedo...<wait><page>
You're going to be the most handsome man in the
whole world. I can't wait.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0622]
Oh, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0623]
Oh, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0624]
I'm thinking about what I'm going to do here in this town.
I haven't decided on any course of action yet, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0625]
Hey, <playername>.
How's the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0626]
Hey, <playername>.
How's the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0627]
I'm the same as always.
You know, something about this quiet town seems to
erase the passage of time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0628]
I go to the Church basically every day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0629]
Carter's an interesting guy.
He looks like a priest, but he doesn't act like one at all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0630]
Just having you around gives me the courage to be
myself, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0631]
Just having you around gives me the courage to be
myself, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0632]
Out of every town I've lived in, I have to say that Mineral
Town has quickly become my favorite.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0633]
You're really strong, <playername>.
I respect that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0634]
You're really strong, <playername>.
I respect that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0635]
Hey, <playername>.
How're you doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0636]
Hey, <playername>.
How're you doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0637]
Lately, my thoughts always seem to wander toward you.
About how you're doing, what you're up to...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0638]
Lately, my thoughts always seem to wander toward you.
About how you're doing, what you're up to...<wait>

[0639]
<playername>!
How's farm life treating you?
Are you working hard?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0640]
<playername>!
How's farm life treating you?
Are you working hard?<wait>

You inspire me to give every day my best,

[0643]
I've been thinking a lot about my role in this town now
that I'm staying here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0644]
At the very least, I'm planning on staying at the Inn
as long as I have the money for it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0645]
Why am I still staying in a guest room? Hahaha, I actually
asked Dudley if I could.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0646]
Things are going well with Ran.
I just get the feeling that she's fussing over me too much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0647]
Ran's a sweet girl.
She's so nice, even to someone like me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0648]
That smile of hers is...nostalgic, somehow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0649]
Ran's really attentive.
Even to a guy like me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0650]
Ran reminds me of my little sister.
Their smiles are exactly the same.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0651]
Hey. What would you think if I said I was staying here
forever?
At the Inn, I mean!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0652]
There's no deep meaning behind it.
I just...like this town. That's all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0653]
Now that <childname>'s been born,
I feel like I know why I'm alive.<wait><page>
I was born to meet you and <childname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0654]
I have so much to be grateful for now.
That I found this town...and that
I met you, <nickname>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0655]
To me, the Church is the core of this town.
It's where everything began.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0656]
When I come here, it brings me back to how I felt
when I first arrived in Mineral Town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0657]
I've been beating myself up for a long time,
but my perspective has changed since I met you,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0658]
I have so much to be grateful for now.
That I found this town...and that
I met you, <nickname>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0659]
Until now, I would come to Church to punish myself.
But now it's different. Now I come to express my
gratitude.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0660]
I have so much to be grateful for.
That I found this town...
That I met Ran...<wait><page>
...and that I met you, too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0661]
Hm...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0662]
Oh, <playername>. I've run out of money, so...
I don't think I can stay here anymore.<wait><page>
It'll be hard to say goodbye.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0663]
Oh, <playername>.
I've run out of money, so...
I don't think I can stay here anymore.<wait><page>

I'm working hard at the Vineyard.
Thank you again for pointing me in the right direction,
<playername>.<wait>

[0665]
I'm working hard at the Vineyard.
Thank you again for pointing me in the right direction,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0666]
Carter said that finding a job was a sign that it's okay
for me to stay in this town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0667]
I couldn't find a job, so I've decided to leave town.<wait><page>
It's hard to say goodbye, but... Thanks for everything.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0668]
I-Is it...
Is it okay that I...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0669]
Are you all right, <nickname>?
Wouldn't want the baby to catch a chill here...
Is that a thing that can happen?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0670]
I'm glad you came to see me, but you should really avoid
coming somewhere this cold as much as possible, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0671]
Welcome, <nickname>.
How's <childname>? Doing well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0672]
It's nice and cool in here. The temperature is regulated
to better preserve the wine.<wait><page>
What did Duke say the reason was, again...?
Ah, that's right--apparently, it "matures" better
this way.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0673]
...
...
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0674]
I'm working right now.
...Sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0675]
Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0676]
Is there some kind of emergency?
If not, could you leave?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0677]
Welcome.
Oh, <nickname>. What's wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0678]
You like it here too, <nickname>?
This place is relaxing.
I'm partial to it myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0679]
Welcome, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0680]
You came to see me?
I appreciate the gesture, but I'm working right now.
Let's talk later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0681]
Hey, <nickname>.
Take it easy, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0682]
My job at the Vineyard is really fulfilling. I have to work
hard to keep up with you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0683]
Hey! It's nice and cool in the Cellar, so it feels great
down here.<wait><page>
I know I feel better after resting someplace comfortable,
so maybe it's the same correlation with wine and flavor?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0684]
I wonder if everyone living here is so nice because
Mineral Town itself is a really nice place...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0685]
Oh... Hey.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0686]
You need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0687]
Hey, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0688]
Hey, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0689]
There's a lot of wine sleeping here.
...Hm? Wine doesn't sleep?
Could've fooled me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0690]
Oh, <playername>.
I'm back at the daily grind. You?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0691]
Oh, <playername>.
I'm back at the daily grind. You?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0692]
Do you have much of a taste for wine,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0693]
Do you have much of a taste for wine,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0694]
Work keeps me busy, but it's a good sort of busy. Thanks
again for helping me find this job, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Work keeps me busy, but it's a good sort of busy. Thanks

Is life on the farm going well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0699]
I'm having a good time here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0700]
Hi, <playername>. How're you?
I'm fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0701]
Hi, <playername>. How're you?
I'm fine.<wait>

[0702]
If you'd never come to this town, <playername>, who
knows where I'd be and what I'd be doing right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0703]
If you'd never come to this town, <playername>, who
knows where I'd be and what I'd be doing right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0704]
I honestly enjoy working here.
I'm really glad I met you, <playername>.<wait>

I'm really glad I met you, <playername>.<wait>

There has to be a way I can repay your kindness
somehow. I want to do SOMETHING.<wait>

[0708]
Hey, <nickname>.
So you came, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0709]
Once <childname> gets bigger, Manna might just
have a run for her money in the chatterbox department.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0710]
Hey, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0711]
I never imagined when I first came here that I'd find
a family in this town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0712]
Hey, how's the farm? Try not to lose heart,
no matter what happens.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0713]
I've been eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the Inn
lately. It's all homemade, so I never get tired of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0714]
Today's the day when I eat with Duke and Manna.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0715]
Even though we're not related,
I think of them as family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0716]
Today's the day when I eat with Manna and Duke.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0717]
The way they fuss over me is a little embarrassing,
but I've come to enjoy it.<wait><page>
It's all thanks to you, <playername>.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[0719]
I'm heading to work now.
Don't overdo it out there, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0720]
You need to be careful now that you're responsible
for two.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0721]
I'm heading to work now.
I have to work hard for <childname>, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0722]
Take good care of <childname>.
I'll try to be back as soon as possible.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0723]
<nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0724]
I'm heading to work right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0725]
I'm heading to work now.<wait><page>
Don't stay out working too late, <nickname>.
It'd be nice if you came home early once in a while.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0726]
Are you heading out too, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0727]
You seem busy with the farm. Let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0728]
I'm heading to work right now.
Is that where you're going too, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0729]
It's always a relief to come back to the farm...because
you're here, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0730]
Well, I'm heading to work now.
Will you walk home with me later, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0731]
The farm life has really grown on me.
I'm glad I get to share it with you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0732]
The farm life has really grown on me.
I'm glad I get to share it with you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0733]
I'm heading back home right now.
There's nothing urgently wrong, is there?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0734]
You shouldn't walk around too much.
You're carrying our child, after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0735]
Oh, <nickname>.
I'm just on my way home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0736]
Is <childname> doing well?
I can't wait to get home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0737]
...
<nickname>...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0738]
I'm on my way home.
Are you still working?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0739]
I'm heading home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0740]
You should head home soon too, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0741]
I'm heading home now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0742]
Did you come out to meet me?
Aww. You haven't changed a bit, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0743]
Did you come out to meet me?
Aww. You haven't changed a bit, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0744]
Are you working, <nickname>?
Come home as soon as you can.
I have a lot to talk to you about.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0745]
Oh, <nickname>. I'm just on my way back.
It's so nice to have someplace to call home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0746]
Home is where my heart is. Even when I'm alone,
the house stands as a reminder that I have a family
who loves me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0747]
The Fireworks Festival's tomorrow. Looking up at
a night sky full of fireworks sounds like a real treat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0748]
Moonlight Night, huh? Could be fun...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0749]
Hard to believe another year's come and gone. I'm sure
we'll all have a good time...and a good new year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0750]
Yo! How ya doin'? Name's Zack. I'm the shipper 'round
these parts. Got anything ya wanna send out yet?<wait><page>
I'll drop by yer farm and pick up what you're shippin' any
day but festivals. I look forward to doin' business with ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0751]
Yo, <playername>! Ya know when my birthday is?
Man, you're good people, y'know that? 'Preciate it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0752]
Yo, thanks!
Now ain't this a hot little number?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0753]
Yo, thanks. 'Preciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0754]
Mighty kind of ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0755]
Huh. Well, uh... 'Preciate the thought, but I ain't got much
use for somethin' like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0756]
Yo, what the heck! Yer brain fulla lead or somethin'?
Ugh, can't even begin to imagine what you were thinkin'...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0757]
Heh, adorable... What? So I like animals, okay?
That a crime where yer from or somethin'?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0758]
*gulp* H-Hey, uh, didn'tcha hear?
I'm not so good 'round the creepy-crawlies, y'know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0759]
Whoa, ya really givin' this t'me?
Great!  Been wantin' one for ages now.
Bet it wasn't easy to get, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0760]
Whoa, ya really givin' this t'me?
Great! Maybe I'll give it to HER as a present.
Thanks, pal. 'Preciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0761]
Oh, hey. Perfume, eh?
What, an' it's for me? Thanks, pal.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0762]
Whoa, thanks. 'Preciate this, pal.
Wonder if maybe I could get the same thing from HER,
too...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0763]
Hey, I know! Why don't I teach ya this recipe I've got
for a Summer Sun?<wait><page>
Hm? Nah, I don't get what it's used for neither.
I've just got the recipe kickin' around, is all.<wait><page>
You'll need a Small Fish, a Medium Fish, and a Large Fish.
And--here's the important part--<wait><page>
An Ancient Fossil and Pirate Treasure. I know where
ya can get the fish, but those last two? No clue.<wait><page>
The recipe says ya don't need no tools, though.
Heck, if you're up to the task, why not try puttin'
it together?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0764]
Maaaan, ya lucky duck! Me, the girl I always had a thing
for went and got married 'fore I could say a thing.<wait><page>
I was so sure she'd at least wait till I was enough
of a man, but...nope. No such luck.
Ah, t'heck with it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0765]
Remember that Fishing Rod I gave ya? It used to belong
to a guy who lived with me. Went by the name'a Greg.<wait><page>
Ain't nothin' Greg loved more than fishin'. Said he was
gonna fish round the world one day, an' took off.<wait><page>
Ain't seen 'im since. Wonder what he's up to nowadays.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0766]
The other day, I took a shipment inta town. <wait><page>
Ran across ol' Takakura, wouldn'tcha know it?
He's a shipper, like me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0767]
We ended up knockin' back some drinks and chattin' 'til
the wee hours. Then the ol' guy got talkin' about his past.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0768]
Said he kinda made some mistakes coverin' for a friend
and wound up wearin' orange for a few years.<wait><page>
Man, the stuff that folks go through in their lives.
Ya never know someone's story till ya talk to 'em.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0769]
Yo, what's the good word?
Come to visit Huang?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0770]
Man, if you'da told me Huang was gonna get hitched
one day--let alone to you, <playername>--
I woulda called ya crazy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0771]
Yo, what's the good word?
Busy with work?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0772]
Keep packin' that Shipping Bin full, y'hear? If it ain't
breakin' my back, ya ain't workin' hard enough!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0773]
Bein' a shipper is a pretty interesting job.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0774]
I get to travel all over the place an' make friends with all
kindsa people.<wait><page>
Chattin' with folks and learnin' about their lives is pretty
fascinatin', too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0775]
Yo, how's the farm comin' along?
Workin' hard or hardly workin'? Ha ha!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0776]
I'll drop by 'round 5:00 PM to do the regular pick-up.
I'm lookin' forward to seein' a full Bin, y'hear me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0777]
Now, <playername>. I'm gonna let ya in on
a little secret.<wait><page>
See, I gave my heart to a certain lady some years back.
'Course, she married someone else, so I won't say who.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0778]
I gotta wonder when old man Rod is gonna come back
home. I'm gettin' real worried for the guy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0779]
Yo, <playername>.
Don't push yerself too hard, y'hear me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0780]
Ya packin' that Shipping Bin nice and full for me?
Don't let me down, now, y'hear? I mean it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0781]
Thanks, pal! 'Preciate it. Lookin' forward t'another big
shipment tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0782]
Yo, <playername>. Ready t'kick back after a hard
day's work?<wait><page>
Huh! Ya sure do put in yer hours. With gusto, even.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0783]
Yo, <playername>. I took those rocks ya shipped
to old man Saibara.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0784]
I can sell 'em for a higher price if he works 'em into
somethin' first, y'know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0785]
Hey, <playername>?
If someone, say...gave a present to a lady outta
nowhere, d'ya think she'd feel creeped out?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0786]
Mmmmm...y'know what? Never mind.
Forget I said anythin'.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0787]
Yo! Ya packin' that Shipping Bin nice and full for me?
Don't let me down, now, y'hear? I mean it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0788]
1... 2... 3... Hm? Ain't it 'bout 5:00 PM now? Wait, it's almost
6:00?! Huh?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0789]
Yo! <playername>! I'm tryin' to work here, y'know!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0790]
Yo! Ya packin' that Shipping Bin nice and full for me?
I'm really relyin' on ya, y'hear? I mean it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0791]
I gotta say, <playername>, the farm life really
suits ya.<wait><page>
That's a compliment. Honest.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0792]
Yo! Workin' hard today? Y'know, the more ya ship,
the more money ya make.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0793]
I'll come pick up whatever yer shippin' at 5:00 PM daily.
Anything after that goes in the next day's shipment.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0794]
I'm glad I stumbled upon this little town of ours.<wait><page>
I can even make ends meet workin' as a shipper here
an' everything.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0795]
I don't live here just 'cuz of my job.<wait><page>
Folk will always find a reason to go on livin', y'know?
I found mine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0796]
Huh? "Am I ready for the Mochi Bonanza?"
You BET I'm ready! I'm gonna eat my weight
in mochi!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0797]
You feelin' that competitive energy, <playername>?
The Derby's comin' up, and it's gonna be a good one!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0798]
Yo, if you're racin' in the Derby tomorrow, I'll cheer you
on at the top of my lungs!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0799]
Hey! What's cookin'? This year's Cookin' Exhibition,
that's what! You makin' anything?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0800]
Bein' a judge for the Cookin' Exhibition sounds cool an' all,
but we got so many good cooks in this town! Must be
tough to choose a winner.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0801]
I am SO READY for the Fetch Fest! How 'bout you,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0802]
The Fetch Fest's tomorrow! Better not be late!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0803]
We got a Derby comin' up, <playername>!
You pumped?! 'Cause I sure am!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0804]
I plan on buyin' some tickets tomorrow!
If you're in the Derby, I'll be placin' my bets
on you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0805]
May I help you?<wait><page>
I see. So you're the person who moved into the farm,
as the mayor mentioned.<wait><page>
My name is Doctor. And as you can see, I'm a physician.
It's nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0806]
Thank you. I had a feeling you were the type to keep this
sort of information tucked away, <nickname>.<wait><page>
I'm glad that you remembered my birthday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0807]
My, my. Well, this is a treat.
Today is my birthday, you see.<wait><page>
Thank you very much for the present.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0808]
Thank you.<wait><page>
Nothing beats the milk from our farm, <nickname>.
I gratefully accept.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0809]
Thank you. This is a thoughtful gift.<wait><page>
With incidences of bone fracturing on the rise, milk
makes an excellent addition to a balanced diet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0810]
Thank you, <nickname>!
You're always so considerate.
Becoming my wife hasn't changed that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0811]
Thank you, <nickname>!
You're always so considerate.
Becoming my husband hasn't changed that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0812]
Wow, thank you! I'll be able to get plenty of use
out of this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0813]
Thank you, <nickname>!
I fully expect my wife to be mindful of her nutritional
intake, after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0814]
Thank you, <nickname>!
I fully expect my husband to be mindful of his nutritional
intake, after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0815]
Oh, you're giving that to me?
You're so considerate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0816]
Thank you, <nickname>.
It looks useful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0817]
Oh, thank you. I'll take it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0818]
...Thank you, <nickname>.
I'll accept it today, but please refrain from doing
this again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0819]
Urgh... Th-Thank you, but this isn't something
I particularly desire.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0820]
<nickname>, I urge you to stop carrying that
around. Your hands will get dirty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0821]
Make sure to properly wash your hands after touching
that, hmm?<wait><page>
Wait...this is...for me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0822]
Is there something wrong with it?<wait><page>
Oh, there isn't.
Well, that's a relief.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0823]
Please do not speak to me while carrying such a thing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0824]
A-Ah! Um...yes?
If you have no business here, then please take that away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0825]
Oh, are you allergic to metal, <nickname>?<wait><page>
In that case, I'll take it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0826]
It's beautiful.
...For me? Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0827]
Did you buy that, <nickname>?
Hm? It's for me?<wait><page>
I...thought it was yours.
I'll take it, then. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0828]
Yes? What about it?
You're giving it to me?<wait><page>
I'll take it, then. Perhaps I might have need of it someday.
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0829]
Smell is often linked to memory.
It's the body's olfactory response.
Incidentally, my mother often wore that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0830]
Long ago, my mother often wore that.
Whenever my father would come back from town,
he'd bring that perfume for her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0831]
My, my. Today's White Day, is it not?
I like this, but what are you doing giving it to me,
<nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0832]
My, my. I suppose today IS White Day.
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0833]
Thank you. I must say, you're a little offbeat to be giving
that to me today, of all days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0834]
Um... I...
No, thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0835]
I suppose today IS the day for it, hm? Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0836]
Thank you. So today's Valentine's Day.
I apologize for not giving you anything on White Day.
How neglectful of me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0837]
Oh. A return gift for White Day, I see.
You didn't have to, but thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0838]
Well, thank you. In return, let me teach you a simple
recipe for Mixed Juice using fruits and vegetables.<wait><page>
Oh, there's nothing around to write it down on. Well, just
try to remember it as best you can, hm?<wait><page>
Combine Fruit Juice and Veggie Juice in a Mixer.
That's it.<wait><page>
It's a simple recipe, but very good for you. Give it a try.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0839]
W-Wait a moment, I...
I'm not emotionally prepared.<wait><page>
For the time being, let's go to your place,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0840]
The Blue Feather...
Is it for someone I know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0841]
Oh... I never dreamed that you felt that way.<wait><page>
I'm grateful to be the object of your affection, but I'm
not quite there yet myself, I'm afraid.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0842]
Do you know of Forgotten Valley?<wait><page>
I've heard rumors that a physician acquaintance of mine
lives around there.<wait><page>
He has something of an...unusual appearance,
but his skills are top-rate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0843]
<playername>, are you aware that Starlight Night
is tomorrow?<wait><page>
I usually spend it with Carter, but I was wondering if you
might see fit to join us this year.<wait><page>
With all three of us, it might be best to have a party
at your place, I reckon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0844]
I'll make some food for us to share, then. Come to the
Clinic after 6:00 PM tomorrow to fetch me.<wait><page>
Let's invite Carter and all go together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0845]
I see... You are no doubt busy enough without my meddling,
I'm sure. Don't trouble yourself over it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0846]
Tomorrow is Starlight Night,
which means a party is in order.
We'll need to prepare a feast.<wait><page>
Make sure you come home tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0847]
We're finally going to be parents.
I couldn't be happier.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0848]
You have nothing to worry about! I'll be with you
the whole way. It's times like these when I'm proud
to be a physician.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0849]
Do you want to know if it's going to be a boy or a girl?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0850]
I don't mind knowing, but there is more excitement to be
found in mystery, in my opinion. Let's hold off on it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0851]
You've gotten much bigger.
Isn't it hard to work?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0852]
Please don't push yourself too hard with your farm work.<wait><page>
I'm saying this not as your physician, but as your husband,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0853]
My, you've gotten big! The baby could come as early
as tomorrow. You should rest for today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0854]
It's all right. I'm right here, and I'll have Elly come, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0855]
I'm relieved that the delivery went smoothly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0856]
In my years as a physician, I've seen many a baby,
but watching my own child enter this world was
special indeed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0857]
<childname> is healthy and growing quickly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0858]
Our baby really takes after you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0859]
<childname> should start walking soon.
At least, based on the average timing
for this sort of thing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0860]
I dearly wish to see the exact moment <childname>
first stands on two feet. But if I'm at work,
well...so it goes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0861]
<childname> certainly is energetic.
You must have passed that trait along,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0862]
Children grow up much faster than we expect. Every day
is a gift, and every surprise is a blessing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0863]
Thank you, <nickname>.
I'm extremely grateful that our child was born healthy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0864]
<childname> should start talking soon.<wait><page>
The future is still full of potential, but it's thanks to you
that I've found my one true source of happiness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0865]
Sorry.
I'm tired today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0866]
Please don't talk to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0867]
Good morning.
Hm? I seem upset?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0868]
You're imagining things.
I'm simply a little tired.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0869]
Welcome back.
You're late.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0870]
Have you been busy recently? I feel like we haven't been
talking very much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0871]
Good morning, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0872]
Come for an examination anytime you need it.
I wish I could waive the fee for my wife,
but protocol is protocol.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0873]
Come for an examination anytime you need it.
I wish I could waive the fee for my husband,
but protocol is protocol.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0874]
Welcome back, <nickname>.
How was your day?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0875]
Me? I have the Clinic, after all.
I'm busy there. Obviously, I can't violate
my patients' privacy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0876]
Good morning, <nickname>.
How are you feeling this morning?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0877]
You're amazing, <nickname>. You never miss
breakfast. That's not true of many people these days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0878]
Welcome home. Do be mindful of your stamina when
you're working, all right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0879]
If you aren't careful about using tools on rainy days,
you'll collapse. The human body needs food to burn
for fuel.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0880]
Morning, <nickname>.
You seem as healthy and hearty as ever today.
Good health is something to celebrate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0881]
Let us each do our best today.
Many people would be in trouble if we didn't do our jobs.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0882]
Welcome home, <nickname>.
Are you done working for today?<wait><page>
Make sure to get a good night's sleep...for your health's
sake, if not for your husband's. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0883]
And should sleep elude you, at least supplement your
habits with nutritious food and the like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0884]
Hey, <nickname>. You should relax and take it easy.<wait><page>
Feel free to come here for a break whenever
you need to.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0885]
Be extra careful when you go outside.
You mustn't trip and fall.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0886]
How is <childname>?
Doing well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0887]
This is the most difficult period of child-rearing.
You should rest if you get weary, <nickname>.<wait><page>
We're family, so don't hesitate to rely on me when
you're in need.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0888]
Do you need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0889]
Then leave!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0890]
Oh, <nickname>. Is something the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0891]
If you have no business here, please leave. I'm working.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0892]
Welcome, <nickname>. Did you come to see me?
Please, make yourself at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0893]
Do try not to bother any of my patients
while you're here.<wait><page>
And some of these tools are dangerous, so I ask that
you refrain from carelessly touching them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0894]
Oh, if it isn't <nickname>.
Did you have some business nearby?
Please, make yourself at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0895]
I'm putting forth my best effort!
For the townspeople, and also for you, <nickname>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0896]
Oh, <nickname>. Welcome.
Please, make yourself at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0897]
I'm glad that you're still taking time out of your busy
schedule to come see me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0898]
I'm glad that you're still taking time out of your busy
schedule to come see me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0899]
I was just speaking with Elly about how much of a relief
it is that you're married now, <playername>.<wait><page>
Hm? Why, you ask?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0900]
When you live alone, no one would know if you had
collapsed or were out late at night. That's a precarious
position to be in.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0901]
Elly may slip up occasionally, but she
is exceptionally grounded and kind.
She's the one holding me together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0902]
The Clinic will remain as it always was, so there is no
need for concern.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0903]
Hello. How are you feeling?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0904]
If you're unwell, come speak to me at any time.
I'll examine you.<wait><page>
Though I'll have to charge you. The Clinic has to stay
afloat somehow, after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0905]
Hello, <playername>. How is your health?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0906]
Elly is a wonderful assistant.
She's incredibly helpful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0907]
*sigh* If only I were stronger...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0908]
I've been a bit depressed recently about how powerless
I am as a physician. *sigh*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0909]
Elly is always worrying about me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0910]
That's no state for a physician to be in. I need to step up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0911]
When Elly is with me, I feel as though I can accomplish
anything.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0912]
Elly and I support one another, allowing each of us to
reach our full potential. That's what I think.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0913]
If we have a child, I hope they become a physician.
Naturally, I'd like them to practice in this town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0914]
Speaking of children, Yu is rather mischievous and
troublesome. He likely only does it to get attention,
though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0915]
Oh, <playername>. I still find it difficult to believe
that we'll be getting married soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0916]
My personality is rather...unique, after all. There is hardly
anyone who truly understands me.<wait><page>
You're the exception, <playername>.
I love you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0917]
Oh, do you feel ill?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0918]
No matter how trivial it may be, if something ails you,
please come see me about it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0919]
Hm? Is everything all right? Is it an emergency?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0920]
It may be my day off today, but please, feel free to see
me any time you feel under the weather.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0921]
Oh, <playername>. How's the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0922]
Rather than shipping all of your crops indiscriminately,
save some and use them to create healthy meals.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0923]
Hello, <playername>. Are you well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0924]
Living alone means you'll need to pay extra attention to
your health.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0925]
Hello, <playername>.
How are you feeling today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0926]
To be honest, I'm concerned about your nutritional intake,
since you're likely overworking yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0927]
Where do you get all your energy?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0928]
You work hard enough to put even a physician like me
to shame.<wait><page>
I suppose strength and endurance exist for people like you
to utilize.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0929]
Recently, I've been beside myself with concern over your
dietary habits, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0930]
Since you live alone, I imagine you eat whatever is most
convenient. Hmmm. That is troubling, to say the least.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0931]
Who am I to you, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0932]
Being with you fills me with vitality and optimism.<wait><page>
I respect your ability to furnish people with a different
kind of health than the type I can give as a physician.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0933]
Yes? Is something the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0934]
We should both be getting to bed soon. Sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0935]
Yes? Is something the matter?
Do you feel ill?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0936]
If you have no business with me,
I would like to call it a day now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0937]
Oh, did you come in search of something to read as well,
<nickname>?<wait><page>
You ought to read to our unborn child as well. If you feel
a kick, that means they're listening. ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0938]
Even if it's not read from a book, simply speaking
to a child in the womb can have positive effects.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0939]
I wish there were picture books here as well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0940]
You don't think <childname> is ready for those?<wait><page>
That isn't true. Simply exposing <childname> to
books could kindle a lifelong interest in literature.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0941]
Do you need something from me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0942]
I would like to read in peace.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0943]
...<nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0944]
Please refrain from speaking with me.
It prevents me from reading.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0945]
Well, now. This is a coincidence. Did you come to read
as well, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0946]
Am I the only one under the impression that this library
is built specifically for you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0947]
Have you benefited from the books in this collection
as well, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0948]
I wish more townspeople would show an interest in
reading. I wonder why they don't?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0949]
Hey, <nickname>. The Library certainly is just the
place to enjoy some peace and quiet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0950]
Perhaps I feel relaxed because you're here,
<nickname>. Family is a miraculous thing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0951]
I sometimes run into Basil on Mother's Hill.<wait><page>
He's a very kind person who goes out of his way to teach
me about medicinal herbs.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0952]
The books that Basil has authored are a wellspring
of knowledge.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0953]
Oh, <nickname>. What's the matter?<wait><page>
You haven't forgotten that you're pregnant now,
have you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0954]
You move so deftly that I can't help but wonder.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0955]
Oh, if it isn't my <nickname>.
How is <childname>? Don't neglect your parental
duties, now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0956]
Some days, <childname> is already asleep by the
time I get home.<wait><page>
I must strive to finish my work earlier.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0957]
<nickname>...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0958]
Leave me alone!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0959]
Oh, <nickname>. What is it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0960]
If you have no business with me, please leave me alone.
I am not in the mood to talk right now!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0961]
Hey, <nickname>. What are you doing in a place
like this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0962]
Is the farm coming along well?<wait><page>
I have the Clinic to mind, so I cannot help you much, but
tell me if anything is wrong. We're married, after all!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0963]
Oh, <nickname>. What a coincidence to meet
in a place like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0964]
Hm? You came to see me? There's no need to worry.
I'll be right home, so please wait for me there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0965]
Hey, <nickname>.
Did you forget something somewhere?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0966]
I'm lucky to be married to a woman like you,
<nickname>. I believe that from the bottom
of my heart.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0967]
I'm lucky to be married to a man like you,
<nickname>. I believe that from the bottom
of my heart.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0968]
On days when the Clinic is closed, I forage for medicinal
herbs on Mother's Hill.<wait><page>
I request shipments of herbs from Zack as well, but the
amount he gives me isn't nearly enough for my needs.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0969]
If you stumble upon another place that has an abundance
of herbs, let me know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0970]
Oh, so you've both come.<wait><page>
When our child is bigger, I'd like to come here together to
pray. I hope I can instill a love of worship in them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0971]
Whether they're a boy or girl, I'm positive that they will
take a liking to Carter.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0972]
Oh, what's the matter?
How is <childname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0973]
I see. Well, good health is what matters most.<wait><page>
Hm? Why am I not more concerned? Carter told me to
set aside my worries as long as I'm here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0974]
Oh, <playername>.
Did you come to see the venue?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0975]
We'll be getting married here.<wait><page>
How amusing it will be to see Carter actually acting like
a priest for once.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0976]
Carter may be a tad...unconventional, but I trust him fully.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0977]
Manna, on the other hand... A while back, I was discussing
something with her.<wait><page>
And the next day, every patient who came to see me
knew every detail of our conversation. I was at a loss.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0978]
Ah, that's right. The Cooking Exhibition is coming up.
Do you suppose they take nutritional content into
account when choosing a theme?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0979]
I wonder what kinds of dishes we can expect from
tomorrow's Cooking Exhibition... I'd love to try the
winning meal.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0980]
With the Harvest Festival around the corner, I can't
help but wonder what kinds of ingredients everyone
will bring...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0981]
I simply cannot wait for the Harvest Festival. We'll be
bringing ingredients and making a special meal together
as a community.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0982]
Moonlight Night, hm? I'm certain it will be a splendid time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0983]
I may not look the type, but I always buy tickets for the
Autumn Derby and cheer the entrants on. It makes the
race even more enjoyable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0984]
Buying tickets for the Autumn Derby makes it all the
more fun. I rather enjoy it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0985]
Welcome! What's your name? <playername>?<wait><page>
I'm Blueberry. It's nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0986]
Tea parties are the reason for the springtime season.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0987]
You brought an invitation? Yay! Everyone, it's time to set
the table for a tea party!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0988]
The whole gang isn't here yet. We can't start the tea
party without them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0989]
Now isn't the right time for a tea party.
Timing is important!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0990]
Awww... We can't have a tea party here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0991]
Guess what? Today's my birthday!
Thank you for the present!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0992]
Yaaay! Wheee! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
I love it to bits!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0993]
Yaaay! Thank you! I like this lots!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0994]
Thank you for the present.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0995]
Um... I don't like this much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0996]
...Ah!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0997]
Hiya, little buddy. It's lotsa fun doing my work.
If you need help, let me know. Okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0998]
EEK! You surprised me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[0999]
Oooooh! Sooo spaaarkly!
It's like a star in your hand.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1000]
Oooh, thank you! Are you sure you don't mind giving me
something this nice?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1001]
Mmm, what a funny smell!
Nothing in the forest smells like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1002]
Oooh, a pretty feather! It's so pretty, I'm sure it must
have special powers.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1003]
Guess what? I heard a rumor that others like us live in
Forgotten Valley.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1004]
Spring is for tea parties.
Tea parties are for spring.
I can hardly waaait!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1005]
Work is important, but so are tea parties.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1006]
Which do you like more, <playername>?
Work or tea parties?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1007]
I can't wait to see you at our next tea party,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1008]
We do lots of fun stuff at our tea parties. We eat snacks,
we drink tea, we chat with friends... It's the best!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1009]
Hmmm... If I had to pick work or a tea party, which would
I choose? Weeell...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1010]
Friends are the secret ingredient that make tea parties
extra fun.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1011]
Ooh, <playername>! If you'll come, we can take a
break from work and throw a tea party!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1012]
Did you come to ask for help with something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1013]
Welcome. Do you need any help?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1014]
Welcome! Can I help you with your work at all?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1015]
<playername>! I THOUGHT you might be coming
soon!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1016]
Umm... I DO like to work, but...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1017]
I like helping out. It's fun.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1018]
It's hard to say no when a friend asks you to help
with work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1019]
I can't wait to go to your farm, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1020]
Do you need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1021]
Ask for help.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1022]
Play together.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1023]
Never mind.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1024]
Okay! I'll work really hard tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1025]
We like to help our friends.
If we were better friends with you, we'd help you, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1026]
What would you like me to do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1027]
Water crops.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1028]
Harvest crops.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1029]
Care for livestock.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1030]
Never mind.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1031]
How long do you want me to water your crops?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1032]
One day.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1033]
Three days.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1034]
Seven days.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1035]
Okay! I'll water your crops for one day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1036]
Okay! I'll water your crops for three days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1037]
Okay! I'll water your crops for seven days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1038]
How long do you want me to harvest your crops?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1039]
Okay! I'll harvest your crops for one day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1040]
Okay! I'll harvest your crops for three days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1041]
Okay! I'll harvest your crops for seven days.<wait>

How long do you want me to care for your livestock?<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1044]
Okay! I'll care for your livestock for three days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1045]
Okay! I'll care for your livestock for seven days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1046]
What? Oh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1047]
We already played together today.
Let's play again tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1048]
We like playing with our friends.
If we were better friends with you,
we'd play with you, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1049]
Which game do you want to play?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1050]
Let's play the watering mini-game!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1051]
I bet I'll be a little better at watering crops now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1052]
Awww! I messed up. It feels like I got a little worse at
watering crops...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1053]
Let's play the harvesting mini-game!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1054]
I bet I'll be a little better at harvesting crops now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1055]
Awww! I messed up. It feels like I got a little worse at
harvesting crops...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1056]
Let's play the livestock care mini-game!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1057]
I bet I'll be a little better at taking care of livestock now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1058]
Awww! I messed up. It feels like I got a little worse at
taking care of livestock...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1059]
Awww! You don't want to play?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1060]
Okay. Come again soon!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1061]
I finished my task for today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1062]
Um, I'm not very used to this yet, so I'm not that good
at it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1063]
I think I'm getting the hang of this!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1064]
Boy, harvesting is a lot of fun!
I'm gonna keep practicing!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1065]
Yay! I'm a harvesting master! You can leave all of your
harvesting to me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1066]
Boy, watering is a lot of fun!
I'm gonna keep practicing!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1067]
Yay! I'm a watering master! You can leave all of your
watering to me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1068]
Boy, caring for animals is a lot of fun! I'm gonna keep
learning about it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1069]
Yay! I'm a master at taking care of animals! You can
leave them in my care anytime you want!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1070]
Keep up the good work!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1071]
You can stop after today.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1072]
Okay! I'll work really hard again tomorrow for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1073]
Okay! After I finish today, I'll be done.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Um... I don't like this much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1115]
...Oh! Boy, that surprised me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1116]
Ooh, how cute. I like little animals.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1117]
Waaah, that's so scaaary.
Take it away. Please take it awaaay.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1118]
Thank you. Are you sure you want to give something this
nice to me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1119]
Oooh... *sniff* *sniff*
It smells pretty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1120]
What a pretty feather.
There's something kind of hip-not-ick about it.
...Is that the right word?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1121]
It's spring. Spring means tea parties.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1122]
We, um...like having tea parties with our friends.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1123]
Are you looking forward to the tea party,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1124]
I like when you get to come to our tea parties,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1125]
...Hmm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1126]
I like spring for two reasons:
one, it's warm. Two, tea parties.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1127]
Tea parties are a good place to catch up with friends.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1128]
I hope you come visit us even when spring is over.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1129]
I'm not gloomy. I'm just shy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1130]
Welcome...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1131]
Um, <playername>? You aren't going to be bossy
to me, are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1132]
If you have a favor to ask, <playername>, I don't mind
listening.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1133]
I like to help, but it IS very tiring...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1134]
I know I can trust you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1135]
You're really nice, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1136]
Hm? Oh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1137]
Okay. I'll start tomorrow.
I promise I'll try really hard.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1138]
Howdy. How are you?
I see, so your name is <playername>?<wait><page>
My name is Pumpkin.
It's nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1139]
Ooh, wow! Did you know that today is my birthday?
Thank you lots!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1140]
Wooow! Yaaay! Thank you, thank you!
I love it a super duper lot!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1141]
Thank you lots! I really like it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1142]
Aww, this isn't what I wanted...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1143]
...Ah!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1144]
Oooh, cute! But please don't bring animals inside
the house.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1145]
OH MY GOURD! I-It isn't going to bite me, is it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1146]
Oooh, that looks interesting! How do you play with it?
...Huh? It isn't a toy?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1147]
Mmm! Smells pretty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1148]
I've never seen a Blue Feather before!
Wonder what kind of bird it comes from.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1149]
Spring means tea parties! Lots and lots of friends come
to our tea parties.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1150]
Do you like tea parties, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1151]
If we had a tea party every day, would you come every
day, too, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1152]
In spring, I think about tea parties aaaall day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1153]
We only send invitations to our tea parties to our
bestest friends.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1154]
A tea party has to have the right decorations, or else it
isn't a tea party.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1155]
I wish it was spring all year round. Then it would be
nonstop tea parties!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1156]
Hm? Oh! Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1157]
Welcome. Wish I had something to do!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1158]
Welcome! Do you want to play with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1159]
Yaaay! <playername> is here!
<playername> is here!
I knew you would come!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1160]
I don't like party poopers.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1161]
Playing beats working any day!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1162]
Ooh! Ooh! What should we play today?
I'm already getting tingly with excitement!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1163]
I have the mostest fun ever when I play with you,
<playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1164]
Awww! Boo. That's too bad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1165]
Okay! We'll start helping tomorrow!
I promise I'll work extra super hard!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1166]
HALT! Who goes there? A sneaky so-and-so?!<wait><page>
Hmm...you don't LOOK like a sneaky so-and-so to me.
Your name is <playername>, huh? Gotcha.
Hi. I'm Plum.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1167]
Wow, didja know today is my birthday?
Thank you for the present!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1168]
Whoa! Thanks very much!
I like it a whooole lot!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1169]
GROSS. I don't like this at all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1170]
Ooh, so mega cute!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1171]
I-I-I'm not scared! I-I was just, um, a little startled!
That's all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1172]
Thanks. I'll take good care of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1173]
What a pretty feather! I almost feel like I'm not worthy
of looking at it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1174]
In spring, we have tea parties.
That's just the way it is.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1175]
We only send tea party invitations to our bestest friends.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1176]
You like tea parties too, right, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1177]
If it meant you would come visit, I'd have a tea party
every day!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1178]
If some sneaky so-and-so were to interrupt one of our
tea parties, I'd really give 'em a piece of my mind!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1179]
Personally, I'd rather have a tea party instead of going
to work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1180]
I'll use these muscles to stand guard for our tea party
and make sure nobody interrupts us!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1181]
If spring lasted all year, we could have as many tea
parties as we wanted.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1182]
I won't tolerate sneaky so-and-sos doing bad stuff around
here!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1183]
Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1184]
Don't worry, <playername>! If you're ever in danger,
I'll rescue you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1185]
<playername>! I knew you would be coming soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1186]
Don't go anywhere with strangers, okay? Even if they
offer you candy!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1187]
I'm good at jobs that need lotsa muscle.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1188]
Next time you come by, maybe I could help out by being
your bodyguard, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1189]
Don't worry, <playername>!
I'm here, so you're safe as safe can be.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1190]
You don't wanna?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1191]
Okay! I'll start tomorrow.
I'm gonna put my back into it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1192]
Hello. And you are?
Oh, your name is <playername>?<wait><page>
I'm Cherry. It's nice to meat--er, meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1193]
How did you know today was my birthday?
Thank you so much!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1194]
Yaaay, I really like these! Thank you lots and lots!
<wait><page>
Oh, <playername>, didja know?<wait><page>
I hear that Kappa likes it when you give him Cucumbers.<wait><page>
But Kappa is weird and likes them RAW.
They're so much better cooked!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1195]
EEEEEK! Stop! Stooop!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1196]
Aaah! Scaaary!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1197]
Ick. I don't like these. They make my tongue go numb,
and then I can't taste food right.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1198]
Guess what, guess what? I know a yummy recipe for
Yam Dessert! Let me teach it to you as thanks!<wait><page>
Even Mr. Dudley at the Inn can't make Yam Dessert as
well as I can. It's the most popular sweet at our tea
parties.<wait><page>
Okay. Are you ready? Right, so, you need Yams, okay?
And Eggs, too. And don't forget the Butter!<wait><page>
You mix them aaall together in a Pot with a little dash of
this and that, and then you bake them in the Oven!<wait><page>
You don't have to add anything else to bring out the
yumminess. They're just naturally that good.<wait><page>
Why don't you try making them at home tonight?
They're the yummiest, yammiest yams in the whole wide
world!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1199]
What a pretty feather. I don't think I have any recipes
that call for feathers, though...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1200]
Spring is tea party season.
Everybody loves tea parties.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1201]
We like to send tea party invitations to all our friends.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1202]
I'd have tea parties every day if it meant you would come
visit, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1203]
I like spring lots. Why?
Because we have tea parties in spring!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1204]
We only give tea party invitations to our very
bestest friends.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1205]
I always make tea and snacks for all our tea parties.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1206]
Welcome! I'm glad to see you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1207]
Yaaay! <playername> is here!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1208]
I had a feeling you'd come soon!
Like a rumbling in my tummy, almost.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1209]
Cooking is love. Cooking is life.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1210]
<playername>, do you cook?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1211]
Hmm. What do I want to cook today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1212]
<playername>, can I help you?
Please? I want to help!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1213]
If you need our help, just say the word.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1214]
Okay! I'll start helping tomorrow!
I'm gonna whisk your farm into shape!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1215]

Oh, your name is <playername>?
No wonder my mind was a clean slate.<wait><page>
I'm Aqua. It's nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1216]
Oh, wow! Did you know today was my birthday?
Thank you so much!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1217]
Yaaay! Thank you, thank you!
This is better than a freshly swept floor!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1218]
H-Huh?! You're scaring me...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1219]
Thaaank yooou!
You really know what I like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1220]
Oooh, such a pretty feather! Just looking at it makes me
feel really happy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1221]
Spring is when we have tea parties. Everyone looks
forward to them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1222]
It's my job to write the tea party invitations for all
our friends.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1223]
Do you like tea parties, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1224]
If you're going to be at our next tea party,
<playername>, then I just KNOW we'll have
a good time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1225]
I write the invitations to our tea parties.
Only our bestest friends make the cut.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1226]
I'm looking for a pretty tablecloth we can use for our
tea party.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1227]
I like to dress up in my fanciest clothes for our parties.
I hope you'll come see how I look, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1228]
Welcome! Please be sure not to make too much of a mess.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1229]
Oh, yay! It's <playername>!
I'm glad you're here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1230]
Ooh! I KNEW you would understand my fancy taste in
fashion, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1231]
I like things that are pretty and neat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1232]
When I work, my clothes get all dirty...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1233]
Light blue is the best of all colors.
Not many people realize that, but it's true.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1234]
I'll make your farm super clean and extra pretty!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1235]
Aww, you don't wanna?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1236]
Okay! I'll start helping tomorrow!
Get ready for me to clean house! Literally!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1237]
Bwuh? Oh. Hi. So...your name is <playername>? Okay.<wait><page>
I'm Sunny. Nice to meetcha.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1238]
HEY! I don't like this at all!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1239]
I-I don't like the way it's looking at me...
I think it thinks I look like dinner...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1240]
Heck yeah! Thanks! I like it lots.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1241]
Oooh! Pretty feather. But last time I checked,
feathers don't taste very good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1242]
I'm always hungry for tea parties in spring.
<playername>, do YOU like tea parties?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1243]
I'd make sure we had tea parties every day if it meant
you'd come, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1244]
I like tea parties because I get to eat aaall sorts of
yummy snacks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1245]
Cherry makes all the tasty goodies for our tea parties.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1246]
I wish it was spring all year long. Then we could have tea
parties all the time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1247]
I'm hungry...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1248]
Did you bring me something scrumptious to eat?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1249]
Yaaay! <playername> is here!
Do you have any presents for me today?
Maybe something...delicious?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1250]
You always seem to drop by right when I'm getting
hungry, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1251]
I've been told I'm a "glut-ton."
What's what mean?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1252]
I can't work if I don't have energy.
I hafta eat to get energy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1253]
You sure know exactly what kind of tasty treats I like,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1254]
If it's for you, <playername>, I don't mind working
even if I get a little hungry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1255]
You don't want to?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1256]
Okay! I'll try my best tomorrow.
I'll keep working even if my tummy rumbles!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1257]
Goodness me. A new face.
You're <playername>, hm? I'm Ellen.
It's a pleasure to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1258]
Oh, my legs?<wait><page>
I have an illness that makes my muscles weak, so I've been
chairbound for some time now. I'm just at that age.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1259]
Oh, my stars and garters. Not that I've worn
garters for many years now! Ho ho!
A present for me?<wait><page>
And so another year passes me by.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1260]
Thank you kindly, sweetheart.
Do come visit me again, you hear?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1261]
Thank you. I love it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1262]
Thank you for going to all the trouble.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1263]
Oh, yes... Erm, thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1264]
Erm... Might I ask why you'd give this to me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1265]
Dear me! How precious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1266]
Dear me. What a rambunctious little one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1267]
Heavens to betsy, it's marvelous!
I could have sworn Sai gave me something similar once...<wait><page>
Or perhaps my memory is simply going.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1268]
My, you're giving this to an old maid like me?<wait><page>
This certainly takes me back to my younger days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1269]
Oh, is that perfume? I didn't know you fancied fragrances
like that, dear.<wait><page>
Hm? It's for me?
Why, thank you. You're very kind.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1270]
Oh, before you go, dear, I'd like to teach you how to make
a Sandwich. In lieu of a recipe, I'll just tell you.<wait><page>
First, use a Knife to slice the Bread and the other
ingredients you'll be adding.<wait><page>
Try using Cucumbers, Tomatoes, or Boiled Eggs.
Elly often makes sandwiches for Yu, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1271]
Gracious sakes, that takes me back.
A Blue Feather... It must be fifty years now since
I got mine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1272]
Did you know that there's another town beyond
Mother's Hill?<wait><page>
I have a friend who lives there, and we write letters
to each other.<wait><page>
Word is, there's a person about your age working
on a farm there too. Kids these days are so spry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1273]
Elly's been taking care of Yu for what feels like her
whole life. She's had it even harder since I fell ill.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1274]
Doctor is very capable for a man his age, so Elly's been
keen on him for a while.<wait><page>
I always used to wonder if they would get married.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1275]
Goodness, it's you, <playername>.
Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1276]
How is <childname> doing?<wait><page>
If only these old legs of mine would cooperate, I could go
dote on the little one anytime I wanted.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1277]
It's gotten warmer out. Like clockwork, Yu comes home
every day with another bug he's found in the dirt.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1278]
This balmy weather sends me right to sleep, I tell you.
Maybe just a short nap...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1279]
Great balls of fire, is it ever hot out! We don't get much
sun in the house, so it's cool in here, at least.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1280]
If you work up a nasty sweat, you'd best take a bath
to wash it off, dear. Otherwise, you'll catch a cold.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1281]
Autumn is the season of bountiful food and drink.
I, for one, always eat well this time of year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1282]
Whenever Doctor goes to gather medicinal herbs,
he brings mushrooms back for us as well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1283]
The snow's piling up outside, isn't it?<wait><page>
It's like this every year. It's so cold that even on clear
days, the sun can't melt all the snow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1284]
The farm can be a lonely place during winter, can't it,
<playername>?<wait><page>
I haven't seen your farm, but I'm sure your animals are
hankering for warmer weather. Sit tight until spring.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1285]
Oh, erm...hello. Can I help you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1286]
Huh? You're greeting all your new neighbors, you say? Oh!
You must be the one who moved into that farm. I'm Jeff.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1287]
What? This is for me? 
Oh, you shouldn't have.<wait><page>
I'm gobsmacked that you knew when my birthday was.
Thank you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1288]
Wow, thank you!
That's so thoughtful of you. I love it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1289]
Thank you! What a nice gesture.
I like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1290]
How kind of you. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1291]
I'm afraid I'm not too fond of stuff like this, sorry to say.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1292]
Huh... All right. I think I see what you're trying to say.
Guess I really left a bad impression on you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1293]
Gosh, what a little cutie pie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1294]
Er, could you please keep that away from me?
I-I'm surprised you don't mind handling it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1295]
What? This is for me? Why, thank you.
You shouldn't have.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1296]
What? This is for me?<wait><page>
Oh, you shouldn't have. I think I'll give it to Sasha.
I'm sure she'll love it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1297]
Wow, that really smells great.
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1298]
What? This is for me?<wait><page>
Why, thank you. Besides my family, you're the only one
who gets presents for me, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1299]
What? This is for me?<wait><page>
Why, thank you. Besides my family, you're the only one
who gets presents for me, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1300]
Huh. So, romance is in the air, eh? Well, I'm rooting for
you. Good luck finding that special someone.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1301]
I hear that <linkedfarmname> raises some unusual crops,
including a flower that can talk. Can you imagine?<wait><page>
I'd be sitting pretty if I had something that unique to sell
at my store.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1302]
Y'know, I heard from Kazan--he's a friend of mine--that
apparently, there's a strange artist in Forgotten Valley.<wait><page>
We're talking kooky enough to insist on making art
using only the human body. No tools at all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1303]
Kaz is good friends with this artist.
So much so that they even wear the same style of gloves.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1304]
Do you need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1305]
You want to work at Duke's Vineyard?
Oh, er...I see.
Now, just between you and me...<wait><page>
Duke was a real schoolyard bully as a kid. Didn't like him
much then; don't care for him much now, either.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1306]
<playername>! Welcome, welcome.
How's the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1307]
<playername>! Welcome, welcome.
How's the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1308]
Aah, I wish I could go see little <childname>.
You know, come to think of it, I AM feeling
a little "sick"...<wait><page>
*cough* Guess I'd better step out for a few
and visit <childname> until I feel better.
Nobody will mind, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1309]
Aah, finally! The day is over.<wait><page>
And yet tomorrow comes quickly on today's heels.
Distressingly quickly, really.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1310]
Running the store isn't easy. I swear my bills are always
piling higher. And everyone is so slow to pay their tabs.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1311]
I feel so sorry for Sasha. We both scraped and saved
when we were younger to open this store, and now...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1312]
Hello there! Come to do some shopping?<wait><page>
Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I'm afraid
we're not open right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1313]
Aaah... There's nothing like relaxing at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1314]
Hello there, <playername>.
Take your time and look around.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1315]
Hello there, <playername>.
Take your time and look around.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1316]
I'm grateful that you pay so promptly for your purchases,
<playername>. Like, REALLY grateful.
I mean it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1317]
I'm grateful that you pay so promptly for your purchases,
<playername>. Like, REALLY grateful.
I mean it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1318]
Erm, welcome. I'm afraid the only thing we have in stock
that might interest a farmer are seeds. I suggest you buy
plenty. As many as you can afford.<wait><page>
I-I'm serious. But, erm... You ought to choose which ones
very carefully. Yes. That's just smart shopping.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1319]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1320]
...Oh, hello. You must have it hard, what with all that
manual labor. Careful you keep your stress level in check.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1321]
I suggest you make friends with as many people as you
can around here. It's a small town, after all.<wait><page>
Yes, it's definitely wise to be friendl-- Ooh, ow, ow. No.
It's all right. I'm fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1322]
Hello there, <playername>.
How's the farm?<wait><page>
I've noticed that it's really starting to look the part
lately.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1323]
Hello there, <playername>.
How's the farm?<wait><page>
I've noticed that it's really starting to look the part
lately.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1324]
So are you, actually. The farm takes after the farmer...or
does the farmer take after the farm? Well, either way. <wait><page>
Seeing you working so hard gives me the courage to work
a little harder myself. Not that my job's as hard as yours.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1325]
I'm getting ready to head over to the Church.
It's my favorite place in town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1326]
Oh, er... I'm on my way to the Clinic. See, my stomach has
been giving me no end of grief lately...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1327]
I was just about to head over to Dudley's place. He's a
good man, that Dudley. I ask him for a lot of advice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1328]
I love how tranquil it is here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1329]
It's wonderfully soothing to both the body and the spirit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1330]
I'm afraid I'm not operating at 100% today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1331]
Though I must say, being here at the Clinic really dulls
the edge of my stress.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1332]
I'm not fond of wine in the slightest. Not one bit.
I understand that a lot of folks have a taste for it,
but not me.<wait><page>
All it takes is one sniff, and... *gag*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1333]
Here's what I don't get: Duke makes wine from the fruit
in his Vineyard and sells it to Dudley, right?<wait><page>
But then he goes to the Inn and pays to have a glass of
his wine back. I don't understand what he's thinking.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1334]
I trust everyone in town. That's why I allow them to buy
things on a tab.<wait><page>
To their credit--heh--everyone DOES pay for what they
purchase...eventually. Some folks just like to take their
time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1335]
Sasha always scolds me over my business practices, but
deep down, I'm sure she understands where I'm coming
from.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1336]
Derby season already? Gosh, time sure flies. I'm looking
forward to it, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1337]
I'm wondering who I should place my bets on for
tomorrow's Derby... Ugh, my stomach hurts just thinking
about it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1338]
The Fetch Fest is pretty soon, huh? Every time it comes
around, it feels like summer's officially arrived.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1339]
Watching the competition is fun, of course, but I'd love to
just relax and sunbathe, too...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1340]
Are you taking part in the Concert?<wait><page>
Karen tells me she's going to be singing again this year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1341]
I've already got butterflies in my stomach for
tomorrow's Concert, and I'm not even in it! I hope
Karen's performance goes off without a hitch...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1342]
The Fluffy Festival's coming up, and everybody seems so
excited for it. Myself included, of course!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1343]
Tomorrow's the Fluffy Festival. I can't wait to find out
who our winner is this year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1344]
We'll be able to help ourselves to all the soba noodles
we can eat come tomorrow. Let's hope my stomach
is up for it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1345]
Hello. A friend was just telling me about how somebody
moved into that old farmhouse. So that's you, huh?<wait><page>
You're <playername>? Got it.
I'm Karen. Pleasure's all mine.<wait>

A birthday present? For me?
Wow! Thanks so much.<wait>

Ohmigosh, really?<wait><page>
I never expected to get a birthday present from you,
<playername>! That's so cool of you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1351]
I know it's my birthday and all, but are you SURE you
want to give me something this pricey? Talk about
sticker shock.<wait><page>
...Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1352]
Wow, is this really for me? No way!
I lucked out so much marrying you, <nickname>. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1353]
Ohmigosh, are you really giving this to me? You have no
idea how much I love it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1354]
Wow, thanks! That's so cool of you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1355]
Ohmigosh, are you really giving this to me?
I really like this kinda stuff.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1356]
Wow, thanks, <nickname>.
I really like this kinda stuff.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1357]
Wow, thanks. That was cool of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1358]
Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1359]
Hey, uh, <nickname>? Let me tell you a little story
about what you're holding. It starts like this: I hate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1360]
Yeah...no. Hard pass.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1361]
It's a no from me, bud. All yours.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1362]
GAH. Uh, how about you save that for someone else
next time, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1363]
So cuuute. Did you come all this way just to show me?
Aww, thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1364]
So...cute...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1365]
Ew! Gross! Get that out of here!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1366]
Ew! What do you think you're doing?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1367]
What, this is for me? Geez, <nickname>, where did
THIS come from all of a sudden?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1368]
What, really?
<playername>, is this for me? Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1369]
What, really?
<playername>, is this for me? Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1370]
No way, this is for me? Just because?
Th-Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1371]
What, this is for me? Geez, <nickname>, where did
THIS come from all of a sudden?<wait><page>
Thanks.<wait>

[1373]
<playername>... Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1374]
Wow, no way! Is this really for me?
Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1375]
Thanks. Say, um, do you mind if I wear this at the next
festival?<wait><page>
I'm sure everyone's going to be like,
"Whaaat?! Karen? Wearing perfume?"
But hey, it smells so beautiful!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1376]
Wow, nice! I wonder if Rick would get mad if I told him I
got something this nice as a present from you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1377]
Holy sticker shock! Now THAT looks pricey!
Are you sure you want to give it to me?<wait><page>
Awesome! Thanks! I'm SO going to show it off
to everyone.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1378]
Thanks. But, uh, you know today's White Day, right?
The one where boys give the gifts.<wait><page>
Don't tell me you've forgotten how holidays work,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1379]
Thanks. Today's White Day, right?<wait><page>
Now that we're married, I can get presents on both
White Day and Valentine's Day. Score!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1380]
What, this is for me?
Thanks. I appreciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1381]
There's always one every year, isn't there? A girl who
gives me chocolates, I mean. Can't say I'm mad at it,
though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1382]
Ooh, you DID make some for me! Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1383]
What, really? Are you sure? I mean, I didn't get YOU
anything for Valentine's Day...<wait><page>
Thanks. I'll savor every bite.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1384]
Wow, cool! Thanks!<wait><page>
So you DID remember that I got you something for
Valentine's Day. Thanks. These look delicious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1385]
Oh, hey, <playername>.
What's that you've got there?<wait><page>
A-Am I three sheets to the wind, or is that a Preserved
Flower? Okay. Yeah. We need to talk about this
somewhere else.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1386]
Oh, hey, <playername>.
What's that you've got there?<wait><page>
A-Am I three sheets to the wind, or is that a Preserved
Flower? Okay. Yeah. We need to talk about this
somewhere else.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1387]
Nice Preserved Flower you've got there. You'd better
put it somewhere safe before you lose it, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1388]
Wha-- But-- I-- ...Deep breaths, Karen.
Uh, can we go to your place to talk this over?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1389]
Wha-- But-- I-- ...Deep breaths, Karen.
Uh, can we go to your place to talk this over?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1390]
Wow, finally decided to tie the knot, eh? Good for you!
I'm totally rooting for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1391]
Huh? A Blue Feather? Yeah, I know what it means.
I...I just don't think I'm ready to take that leap yet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1392]
Hey, <playername>! You know tomorrow's
Starlight Night, right?<wait><page>
My family's going to be throwing a party.
You can come too, if you want.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1393]
You will? Cool. We'll keep a seat warm for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1394]
Really? Aww, that stinks. Well, if you can't come,
you can't come. That's fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1395]
Tomorrow's Starlight Night, so make sure to be home
by 6:00 PM, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1396]
Man, I had no clue I was pregnant.
One day I'm hanging out, doing Karen things,
and the next? Boom. Baby incoming.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1397]
Now that I think about it, it's no wonder I've felt so gross
every morning lately. Guess that's pregnancy. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1398]
Y'know, it still hasn't really sunk in that I'm pregnant.<wait><page>
I still feel pretty nasty in the mornings, though. That part
I can guarantee is 100% real.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1399]
The other day, Mom told me I'd changed. She said I look
like a mother now. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1400]
Phew... Even just walking around is getting really
tiring now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1401]
Any day now, baby... Come on out and stop making your
mommy's back hurt so much. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1402]
It looks like tomorrow's going to be the big day. Elly and
Doctor have already said they'll be here for us.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1403]
You'll hang around here tomorrow too, right,
<nickname>? And I'd be really happy if you came
home early today. ∀ <wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1404]
*yaaaawn*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1405]
Ugh, this kid of ours sure has a strong set of pipes.
The crying never stops. I'm so sleep deprived,
it isn't funny.<wait><page>
When I see you snoring the night away,
<nickname>, I get this reeeally dark urge to shake
you awake...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1406]
Man, what a rowdy little squirt!
Who'd they get THAT from, I wonder...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1407]
Happy, smiling babies make for happy, smiling parents,
don'tcha think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1408]
Kids grow up so fast...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1409]
Look. Little <childname> is learning how to walk.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1410]
*sigh* Morning. Nobody told me raising kids
was this rough.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1411]
You can't take your eyes off of our kid for so much as a
second, or else POOF! It's bye-bye baby.<wait><page>
<childname> has been running in circles for...well,
who knows how long now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1412]
Morning. It always surprises me just how darn FAST
kids grow.<wait><page>
I used to get so nervous and excited every time our baby
would do something new for the first time...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1413]
I think I'm finally getting the hang of this Mom business.
...I'm so glad we had <childname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1414]
Sorry. I'm not in the mood to talk now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1415]
Just leave me alone, would you? Geez.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1416]
Morning. Okay, what's first on the agenda today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1417]
I've never been a big morning person.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1418]
Ugh. Trying to think of something to cook for supper
every day is so darn exhausting.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1419]
Oh, spare me the worried look, please.
I'll come up with something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1420]
Morning. Another day, another opportunity to knock our
chores down flat on their chore-butts.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1421]
*yaaawn* So sleepy...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1422]
I'm trying to think up something to make
for dinner tonight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1423]
You sure YOU don't want to hop into the kitchen instead?
You ARE a teeny bit better at cooking than I am...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1424]
Morning. Hee hee. You were sleeping so soundly all night.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1425]
Y'know, sharing a living space with so many animals is
actually pretty fun.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1426]
Lately, even meal planning for the family isn't the slog it
used to be.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1427]
Actually making it is even more fun, of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1428]
Morning, <nickname>. ∀<wait><page>
Aah... What a beautiful morning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1429]
There's so much I want to do that I can hardly decide
where to start. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1430]
At the moment, I'm trying to think up juuust the right
thing to make for your supper tonight, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1431]
Oh, what to make? ∀
This? Or maybe...that?
I can't make up my mind! ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1432]
Oh! <nickname>. Welcome.<wait><page>
I know, I know. I'm driving the ol' baby bus.
I haven't forgotten. I promise I'll take it easy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1433]
Thanks for being concerned for me, but you don't have to
worry so much. 'Kay? ∀<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1434]
<nickname>, welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1435]
Is <childname> behaving today?<wait><page>
When you head home, could you let 'em know that Mama
will be back soon? Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1436]
I don't want to talk to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1437]
...Hmph.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1438]
Welcome. Oh. It's you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1439]
I'm busy right now.
Just leave me alone, would you? Geez.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1440]
Welcome. Oh, hey, <nickname>. What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1441]
Come to do some shopping? Since you're here, why don't
you go ahead and clean out our whole stock?<wait><page>
Heh heh. I'm just kidding.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1442]
Welcome. Oh, hey, <nickname>. What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1443]
What, you came to check up on me? Don't worry,
I'm fiiine. I'm helping with what I know I can handle.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1444]
Hey, <nickname>. Take your time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1445]
Okay, time to get to work. I'll be back by evening.
Wait for me, 'kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1446]
Oh, hey, <playername>.<wait><page>
I always help out at my parents' place on Sundays.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1447]
How's your spouse doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1448]
Not interested in getting married, <playername>?<wait><page>
I'd think having a partner there to help would make your
farm work a lot easier, at the very least.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1449]
Y'know, I get so worried for the chickens when it's rainy
out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Yo, <playername>. Welcome.

[1452]
So, how's married life treating you, <playername>?
Is Rick holding up his end of the bargain?<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1454]
Yo. How's Rick doing?<wait><page>
He can be reeeal gung-ho sometimes, but I'm betting
that translates to things being a lot easier for you
on the farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1455]
Y'know, I'm glad you have some family here now,
<playername>.<wait><page>
Facing the world all alone can make a girl feel pretty
isolated, you know?<wait>

Yo, <playername>. How's Rick doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1459]
Isn't it a great feeling to go back home knowing
there's a family there waiting for you?<wait><page>
I was starting to wonder if you wanted to live the
bachelorette life forever, <playername>.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1465]
What's up? Need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1466]
Hey, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1467]
Hey, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1468]
You look busy, as always. You aren't overworking
yourself, are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1469]
Well, well. If it isn't <playername>.
How goes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1470]
Well, well. If it isn't <playername>.
How goes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1471]
Y'know what, <playername>? You're pretty
impressive. Not just any gal could run a farm
all on their lonesome.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1474]
Yo, <playername>. What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1475]
Wow, we really are getting married, aren't we? I'll get to
wear a wedding dress and everything. I'm stoked! ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1476]
...Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1477]
Can I help you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1478]
Oh. Hey.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1479]
If you need anything, just let me know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1480]
Yeah, our selection's pretty lousy, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1481]
But we DO have a lot of stuff you'll need to run a farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1482]
Man, Mom and Dad sure do get into arguments
a whole lot.<wait><page>
Well, okay. It's more Mom chewing Dad out than
an actual two-sided argument.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1483]
But give them two minutes, and they'll have completely
made up and forgotten all about it. What a couple of
weirdos.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1484]
Ah! Yo, <playername>! How's it going?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1485]
Ah! Yo, <playername>! How's it going?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1486]
Knowing someone my age is running a farm as a solo gig
is impressive. I've got a lot of respect for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1487]
WHOA! O-Oh, um, hey.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1488]
You really caught me off guard. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1489]
Y'know? Lately, my thoughts tend to drift to you before
I even realize it. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1490]
Y'know? Lately, my thoughts tend to drift to you before
I even realize it. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1491]
Haha! Just pulling your leg! But, um... What would you do
if I told you that for real?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1492]
Ah! Hey, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1493]
Eesh. It's really started coming down.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1494]
Hey. Real nice weather we're having, eh?
The Goddess Spring is gorgeous on days
like these.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1495]
Evening! Long day?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1496]
Evening, <playername>.
Big ocean fan?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1497]
Evening, <playername>.
Big ocean fan?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1498]
I like watching the ocean at night, letting the sound of
the waves wash over me... It makes me feel nostalgic.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1499]
Y'know, I really like hanging out here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1500]
When I was little, I was sure that as long as I was
patient enough, I'd eventually get to meet the Goddess.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1501]
Yo! Throwing back a pint of the good stuff?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1502]
It'd be so easy if you could just drink all your problems
away, but life isn't that simple.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1503]
Oh, hey. What a coincidence.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1504]
I'll sometimes come hang out here when it's snowing or
raining. The old carpenter and I get along real well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1505]
Hey, <playername>.<wait><page>
Taking care of chickens is a lot more work than you'd
think.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1506]
I'm really enjoying my new life.<wait><page>
Rick and Lillia are teaching me so much. I'm doing the
best I can to fill Popuri's shoes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1507]
Ah! Hey, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1508]
Hey, get this...<wait><page>
Whenever Popuri comes home to visit, it's like Rick
completely forgets I exist.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1509]
Hey, <playername>. How's it going?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1510]
You've got a good head on your shoulders,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1511]
Morning, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1512]
Now that I'm helping raise chickens, I'm starting to get
an idea of how strenuous farm work can be.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1513]
Yo, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1514]
I have eggs at least once a day now.
But I love eggs, so I'm ALL for that. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1515]
Evening, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1516]
Don't you think it's about time you head home,
<playername>? Tomorrow's a new day, and it's right
around the corner.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1517]
Take care on your way home, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1518]
It's almost the Spring Derby! I can't wait to see those
horses go!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1519]
Just you watch, I am DEFINITELY gonna bet on a
winner this year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1520]
The Cooking Exhibition's coming up... What kind of theme
d'you think they'll pick?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1521]
All right! I'm gonna give it my all and cook with my best
fork forward tomorrow!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1522]
It's already getting to be Concert time, huh?
Better start practicing for my solo.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1523]
Please, pleeease don't let me mess up the vocals at the
Concert tomorrow...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1524]
You're going to the Fireworks Festival tomorrow, too,
aren't you? I hope you're looking forward to it as much
as I am!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1525]
Hmm... Oh, hey there, <playername>! I'm trying
to figure out what I should bring to this year's
Harvest Festival...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1526]
I've gotta bring the tastiest thing I can think of to
tomorrow's Harvest Festival.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1527]
Moonlight Night's tomorrow!
I'm hoping for a fantastic view!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1528]
Wow, already that time of year for the Fluffy Festival,
huh? I hope everyone's getting hyped up about it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1529]
I wonder if anyone's entering their alpacas?
That would be the best...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1530]
Hm? Why, hello there. And you are?
Ah, yes, yes. Mayor Thomas told us you would be coming.<wait><page>
I'm Sasha. My family runs the General Store. I do hope
you'll drop by every once in a while.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1531]
My word! How very thoughtful of you!
Goodness, how long have you known about
my birthday? Thank you, sweetheart.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1532]
My, my! How thoughtful of you.
I like this ever so much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1533]
My, how thoughtful! No matter how old you get, it always
feels nice to get a present, don't you think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1534]
Oh, how thoughtful. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1535]
I don't think so, dear.
I'm sorry, but I can't stomach that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1536]
Goodness, take that away!
I can barely stand looking at it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1537]
My, my! What a precious little darling.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1538]
EEEK! For Goddess's sake! What ARE you doing?!
You're a little old to be pulling these sorts of pranks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1539]
Oh, how lovely! Is this really for me? Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1540]
Oh, how lovely! You certainly know the way
to a lady's heart.<wait><page>
I bet I'm not the first person to compliment your
impeccable taste.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1541]
Oh, how lovely! You certainly know the way
to a lady's heart.<wait><page>
I bet I'm not the first person to compliment your
impeccable taste.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1542]
Oh, how beautiful!
Where did you get this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1543]
Listen, how about I teach you my recipe for
Chocolate Cookies?<wait><page>
You'll need Wheat Flour, Chocolate, Eggs,
and Butter. Oh, and a Seasoning Set, too.
You make them with a Rolling Pin and Oven.<wait><page>
I always have to hide mine from Jeff or else he'll eat
them all. Karen, though? Her palate is biased toward
the savory.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1544]
Goodness, now doesn't THAT send me down memory lane?
I still have the one Jeff gave me tucked safely away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1545]
I was chatting with a friend of mine when she started
bragging about how her son made it into a world track
meet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1546]
Imagine that! A world track meet. Oh, what WAS her
son's name again...? Hugh? Have you heard of him?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1547]
Welcome, <playername>. How is Karen treating you?
Enjoying married life together?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1548]
How is my precious little <childname>? I must say,
Karen certainly has passed along some good traits.<wait><page>
Ooh, my grandmother instincts have been activated!
Do you mind if I go visit the little one?
Like, perhaps today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1549]
How are you doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1550]
If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to let me know,
dear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1551]
My husband insists that he can tell when heavy rain or
snow is coming because his heartburn will act up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1552]
Now, I've never had heartburn in my life, so I'm a tad
dubious about the climate connection, but if he says so...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1553]
Welcome. How fares the farm?
Enjoying your work?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1554]
I enjoy my work here in the store quite a bit.
Finding a job that you enjoy is the secret to
a happy life.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1555]
*siiigh* My husband let a customer put something on
their tab yet again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1556]
Well, you know what? That's just fine and dandy with me.
I've gotten a taste for the debt collector role lately.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1557]
My, my! Welcome.
Found what you need already?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1558]
Come again now, would you?
Always a pleasure to see you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1559]
Well, hello there!
A lovely day today, isn't it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1560]
Goodness, I'd best get home and start on dinner. Losing
track of time like this has become a bad habit of mine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1561]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
Fancy meeting you here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1562]
Poor old Mugi only has little Mei to help him run
Yodel Ranch. Life isn't easy for them, I'm sure.<wait><page>
If you have a chance, why don't you swing on by and see
if you can't lend them a hand with this or that, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1563]
Oh, hello, <playername>. Sunny weather makes for
a sunny disposition, wouldn't you say?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1564]
Are you learning a lot from Mugi? He's such a kind and
helpful old gentleman.<wait><page>
He's been sweet to me ever since I was a little girl. I still
remember how he let me trot around on his horse.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1565]
Lillia has always been frail, the poor thing. Back when
Doctor's father first came to town, he examined her...<wait><page>
...and he made it very clear that an active lifestyle was
just not in the cards for her. A shame, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1566]
Now, Lillia and I have been best friends for ages.
When I heard her prognosis, I nearly fainted,
but she just smiled.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1567]
I told myself, right then and there, that I would have
to do all the things that she couldn't. For her sake.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1568]
Lillia's husband is a good man, but when an idea
gets into his head, he becomes fixated on it.
Where HAS he gotten to?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1569]
Goodness! He really ought to come back home--and soon.
Poor Lillia has been left waiting and waiting...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1570]
I like to spend my afternoons catching up with Ellen.<wait><page>
Her granddaughter, Elly, is such a sweet girl. Talk about
someone with her head screwed on good and tight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1571]
Karen's a natural-born caretaker, but the trade-off is
that she often forgets to take care of herself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1572]
Yu is such a rambunctious little troublemaker. He sure
enjoys his pranks. Poor Ellen has a hard time keeping up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1573]
Well, I suppose that's better than him staying cooped up
in his room all day. Getting out and about is good for kids.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1574]
Oh, really?! Mhm...
Mhm... And then...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1575]
Ahahaha! You don't say?
Mhm... And...did?<wait><page>
But are you sure it... 
The...instead?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1576]
Well, hello! How fares the farm?
All is going well, I hope?<wait><page>
We're lucky to have Karen here to lean on when it comes
to the store. And what a big help she is!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1577]
My husband can't seem to stop letting customers make
their purchases on a tab. I swear, we're not a soup
kitchen...<wait><page>
Still, his inclination to be so kind and trusting is one of
many reasons why I fell in love with him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1578]
Will you be participating in the Derby this season,
<playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1579]
Jeff insists he'll get me a gift with all his medals
this year.<wait><page>
If he were to win, though, I'm not sure if he
actually would...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1580]
I wonder what kind of theme they'll choose for this
year's Cooking Exhibition...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1581]
Tomorrow's the Cooking Exhibition, but I can't help but
worry about what Karen will...create. I do hope she'll be
all right...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1582]
I'm looking forward to the upcoming Fetch Fest, but the
summer heat? Not so much...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1583]
The animals that take part in the Fetch Fest always
work so hard out there! It's just adorable!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1584]
The Concert's in a few days... Will you be playing
something, <playername>?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1585]
Karen's going to be singing tomorrow. I can't wait to
hear her performance!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1586]
Making a delicious communal meal with everyone's
ingredients is the heart and soul behind the
Harvest Festival.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1587]
The best part of the Harvest Festival is finding out what
we'll be able to make from our ingredients! I wonder
what we'll have this year...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1588]
It's so lovely to be able to ring in the new year with
everyone. And we'll have lots of soba noodles to look
forward to afterwards!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1589]
Oh, I haven't seen you around before.
You say you moved into that farm?<wait><page>
I'm Dudley, and I run our town's Inn.
Good to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1590]
Whoa, wait a sec.
This is a little embarrassing.<wait><page>
I didn't expect a birthday present from anyone other
than Ran.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1591]
Hey, thanks! I love it. Seriously.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1592]
Thanks. Sorry to put you out like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1593]
Hey, I'll take it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1594]
Now you've put me on the spot.
Well...I guess since you're offering...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1595]
Hold on, back it up. What exactly do you expect me to do
with this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1596]
Hahaha! Adorable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1597]
Even I have animals I don't like.
Congrats. You found one that fits the description.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1598]
What, you're giving this to me?<wait><page>
You know, if you want to give a gift to Ran, you don't
have to go through me. Be more assertive, y'know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1599]
I think I gave something similar to Ran's mother once
upon a time.<wait><page>
Thanks. I'll pass it along to Ran.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1600]
Perfume, huh? I think I gave that to HER as a gift once
upon a time.<wait><page>
Guess I'll give it to Ran. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1601]
Oh, now that I think of it, today IS Valentine's Day, huh?
Thanks, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1602]
Oh, hey, let me teach you how to make Cheese Fondue.<wait><page>
Do you know what that is? I'll tell you the recipe right
now, so clear some space out in that noggin, eh?<wait><page>
The main ingredient is Cheese, and then you need Bread
or veggies. I'd wager that Eggplants or Carrots are best.<wait><page>
All you need to make it is a Pot. Whaddaya think?
Pretty easy, right? Try it once and you'll be hooked.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1603]
Oh, so you got your hands on a Blue Feather, huh?
You need that to propose. Well, good luck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1604]
You know Bon Vivant, the guy who acts as the judge
for our Cooking Exhibition?<wait><page>
Turns out he's pretty famous in the food biz. He travels
the whole world looking for new things to eat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1605]
Apparently, a guy named Griffin runs a bar
in Forgotten Valley.<wait><page>
Word is, he's come to Mineral Town at least once
or twice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1606]
Griffin used to be a famous musician way back when.
He toured around the world.<wait><page>
I even went to see one of his concerts with Ran's mother,
if you can believe it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1607]
Welcome. Ah, it's you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1608]
How's <childname> doing?<wait><page>
I'll be sure to buy a ton of toys before I come over next.
I can't wait to see that cute little smile.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1609]
How's Ran doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1610]
As long as she isn't causing you any trouble...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1611]
...Then I have nothing to worry about.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1612]
Cliff is a real stand-up guy.
He promises he'll stay here forever.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1613]
I wonder if she's happy up in heaven, too...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1614]
Hey, <playername>. What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1615]
As you can see, we're already closed for the day.
I'll be heading to bed shortly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1616]
Hey. How're things going?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1617]
Well, take it easy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1618]
Hey, nice to see you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1619]
Let's get some calories in you so you have the energy
to keep working hard, eh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1620]
Hey, <playername>.
Here to unwind a little?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1621]
We're in business all year round, so there's no time
for me to rest. Such is the curse of being an innkeeper.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1622]
Hey, what d'you want at this time of day?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1623]
Come back when we're open.
Ugh, I'm bushed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1624]
I'm cooking right now. Mind taking a few steps back?
Wouldn't want you to get burned or something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1625]
I'm busy, pal. Wait out front. If you want something,
I'll take your order later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1626]
Hey...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1627]
Ran's taking care of the Inn. I admit I'm worried about
her being on her own.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1628]
Hey, <playername>...
A year passes by so quickly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1629]
Is there anyone you'd give the world to see just one more
time, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1630]
Dunno what I'd do without Ran. It's more or less thanks
to her that this place is still up and running.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1631]
Working hard, eating well, drinking plenty, and getting
a good night's sleep... There's nothing better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1632]
I'm sure you're as excited about tomorrow's
Mochi Bonanza as everyone else, but just
be careful you don't overeat.<wait>

[1633]
Another Spring Derby's coming along, eh? I wonder what
sorts of horses we'll get to see compete this year...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1634]
You gonna be entering in tomorrow's Derby,
<playername>?<wait><page>
...Either way, I gotta buy me some tickets.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1635]
Will you be entering the Cooking Exhibition, too,
<playername>?<wait><page>
Well, either way, I can't afford to be so easily beaten.
I've got a name to uphold, after all!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1636]
Now, what's the theme gonna be for tomorrow's
Cooking Exhibition...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1637]
I'm on the lookout for a good chicken at the Cluck-Cluck
Clash. I'm sure the chickens there must lay high-quality
eggs...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1638]
So, how about tomorrow's Cluck-Cluck Clash,
<playername>? You gonna enter one of your birds?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1639]
Hmm... I've gotta bring the best-quality ingredient we've
got for the Harvest Festival.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1640]
It's a real treat to see what kind of meal the town can
cook up together at the Harvest Festival. I can't wait
for this year's.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1641]
Well, it's Autumn Derby time once again. I'm sure there'll
be some fine horses racing this season.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1642]
Oh yeah, are you racing in the Derby, <playername>?<wait><page>
Either way, I've gotta get me some tickets.
It's much more fun to watch that way.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1643]
Tomorrow marks the end of another year.
You'll be coming to the New Year's Party,
won't you, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1644]
Hm? Sorry, who are you?<wait><page>
Ohhh, you're the girl who took over that farm. I thought
for sure you were a guest. What's your name?<wait><page>
That's pronounced, uh... "<playername>," you said?
I'm Ran! Nice to meet you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1645]
Hm? Sorry, who are you?<wait><page>
Ohhh, you're the guy who took over that farm. I thought
for sure you were a guest. What's your name?<wait><page>
That's pronounced, uh... "<playername>," you said?
I'm Ran! Nice to meet you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1646]
A birthday present? For me?
Awww... I'm super happy. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1647]
Whoa, is that a birthday present?
Eee! I'm so happy!<wait>

Tickled piiink! Wooo!<wait>

Huh? A birthday present? For me?
Wow, thanks! It's wonderful!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1650]
Thanks. Getting such an amazing present has made this
the best birthday EVER.<wait>

You're so thoughtful, <nickname>.
I love you. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Whoa! Heeeck yeah!

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1657]
Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1658]
Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1659]
What? I shouldn't be picky?
But... Well, I guess you're right.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1660]
Wait, you're giving this to me, not just showing it to me?
Um... Thanks, I guess?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1661]
Ugh! You should know better than to bring something like
that to me on purpose!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1662]
Just because I like to clean doesn't mean you should
bring me trash! Throw it away yourself!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1663]
Awww, so cute!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1664]
Eee! It's so cute!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1665]
Eek! <nickname>, you meanie!
You're the worst!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1666]
Whoa! That about gave me a heart attack!
Quit messing with me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1667]
Waitwaitwait...what? For ME?
No way! Thanks so much!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1668]
Whoa, can I really have this?
Yeah? Thank you.<wait><page>
...You SURE you're sure?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1669]
Whoooa! That looks so expensive.
You're really giving it to me?
Th-Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1670]
I love it.
Thanks, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1671]
Wow, you're giving this to me?
Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1672]
Th-This is for me?
Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1673]
Huh? Perfume?
*sniff* Smells nice.
Like...happiness in a bottle.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1674]
Huh? You sure?
Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1675]
Uh, I'm not exactly sure I'm a sophisticated enough girl
to be wearing perfume...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1676]
Huh? You think I am?
Well, thanks. I'll treasure it, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1677]
Huh? You're giving this to me?
Thanks. Hey, wait...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1678]
Isn't today White Day?
Can I...really have this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1679]
Thanks. I'm seriously blushing here.<wait><page>
I never thought I'd get chocolates from a girl.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1680]
Thanks. I'm seriously blushing here.<wait><page>
I never thought I'd get chocolates from a guy on
Valentine's Day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1681]
Wow, that looks GREAT!
White Day is the best holiday ever.<wait><page>
Yeaaah, I think this beats the pants off of the ones
I made.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1682]
Whoa, cookies!
Wait, is this for White Day?<wait><page>
Now I feel bad that I didn't give you anything
on Valentine's Day. I will this year. Promise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1683]
Th-Thanks. But you don't have to give me something just
because I gave something to you, y'know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1684]
You look like you're doing well, <playername>.
Don't overwork yourself on that farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1685]
You look like you're doing well, <playername>.
Don't overwork yourself on that farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1686]
Huh? A P-Preserved Flower? Um... Right.
Sidebar at your house, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1687]
That's a Preserved Flower, right?
Neat. Who're you giving that to?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1688]
Oh! <playername>...
A-Anyway, let's go to your house.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1689]
Oh! <playername>...
A-Anyway, let's go to your house.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1690]
Awesome! Congratulations.
You'd better get going.<wait><page>
I'm sure your special someone is waiting for you,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1691]
Awesome! Congratulations.
You'd better get going.<wait><page>
I'm sure your special someone is waiting for you,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1692]
A Blue Feather? Hmmm, I think it's a little early in our
relationship for me to be accepting that...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1693]
Let's have dinner together tomorrow for Starlight
Night! I'll handle the cooking, so grab a bib
and come hungry!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1694]
Really? You'll come?
All right! I'll be waiting!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1695]
Awww. Well, if you've got other plans, there's not much
you can do about that. I understand.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1696]
I'm gonna make a feast for Starlight Night tomorrow.
Dinner should be on the table around 6:00 PM.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1697]
It's kinda embarrassing, actually.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1698]
When I told Elly I thought I'd overindulged, she just
laughed at me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1699]
Morning!
I'm feeling great today!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1700]
I'm fine. Totally fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1701]
Urgh...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1702]
Check it out!
My belly's gotten bigger!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1703]
I don't seem nervous, huh? It's actually kinda cool seeing
my body change. Hahaha! ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1704]
When I went to the Clinic yesterday, they said the baby
might be born tomorrow!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1705]
Elly and Doctor are coming tomorrow, so clear your
schedule for me, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1706]
Aaagh, I'm so busy!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1707]
And here I thought babies just slept all the time!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1708]
<childname>'s face is getting more and more
defined. We've got a little person growing up before
our eyes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1709]
Dad keeps going on about how <childname> is
starting to take a lot after him.<wait><page>
But let's be real: <childname> is gonna take after
you and me, duh!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1710]
<childname> seems to love the cows!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1711]
Don't worry. You're still <childname>'s favorite,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1712]
Hey, I'd like to go on a picnic with the three of us soon. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1713]
Hey, I'd like to go on a picnic with the three of us soon. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1714]
I wanna go to the mountain and show <childname>
butterflies and rabbits.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1715]
Morning.<wait><page>
Didja notice that <childname>'s started talking
a little bit recently?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1716]
It's funny. We're on a farm, so the only words
<childname> knows are 'moo moo' and...other
rustic stuff like that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1717]
Uuugh. This is the worst.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1718]
Leave me alone!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1719]
Well, anyway... My morning chores aren't gonna do
themselves.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1720]
What? Don't you have work to do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1721]
Ugh, I'm full-on hangry!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1722]
You don't care what we eat, do you?
You never seem to comment on anything I make.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1723]
Morning! Let's hit today with everything we've got!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1724]
It's time to get to work!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1725]
Working really gets the ol' appetite going, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1726]
All right, gotta keep at it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1727]
Morning! Whaddaya think?
Is today gonna be another good day?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1728]
Eat, sleep, work, repeat!
Farming is love! Farming is life!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1729]
Hey! What d'you wanna eat? I've gotta get Dad to teach
me some more recipes!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1730]
The secret to good health is eating three square meals
a day!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1731]
...Hmph.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1732]
Oh, <nickname>! ∀
Goooood morning!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1733]
Oh, <nickname>! ∀
Goooood morning!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1734]
I'm living the dream. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1735]
I'm living the dream. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1736]
Hey, <nickname>. ∀
Whaddaya wanna do for food?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1737]
Hey, <nickname>. ∀
Whaddaya wanna do for food?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1738]
Hmm... I dunno what to make.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1739]
Oh, it's you, <nickname>.
What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1740]
I showed up at work today, and hoo boy, did Dad ever give
me an earful.<wait><page>
He was all like, 'You can't work in that state! Just lie
down and relax!'<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1741]
Welcome, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1742]
Dad's been saying that we should all live at the Inn
together.<wait><page>
But we can't do that.
You think so too, right, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1743]
...Hmph.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1744]
Ugh, gimme a break!
You're in my way!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1745]
You need something, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1746]
Standing around there is dangerous.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1747]
Everything feels more rewarding after you've put in
a hard day's work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1748]
All right, I've gotta keep at it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1749]
Swinging by for a bite to eat, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1750]
Dad's teaching me how to make lotsa stuff. I'll be taking
his recipes for a spin soon, so prime those taste buds.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1751]
<nickname>, I couldn't be happier.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1752]
Huh? Whaddaya mean, "that's embarrassing"?
Well, it's the truth, so I don't care who hears me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1753]
Welcome, <playername>.<wait><page>
We're closing at 5:00 PM today, just FYI.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1754]
Today's the anniversary of Mom's...
Ahem. Anyway, Dad's taking the day off!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1755]
Welcome, <playername>.
Make yourself at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1756]
Dad's been in a great mood lately.
He says Cliff's like a son to him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1757]
Hey there, <playername>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1758]
It sounds like Cliff's got a knack for his job.
That's a relief.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1759]
<playername>, how's the farm doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1760]
Apparently, Cliff thinks of me as a little sister.
That's...kinda depressing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1761]
Welcome, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1762]
Get a load of this!
Cliff and I had a fight!<wait><page>
He said I should act more like a girl. Isn't that awful? The
heck does that even MEAN?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1763]
Cliff's a seriously hard worker.
I really respect that about him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1764]
I dunno what to do. Cliff and Dad are all buddy-buddy
now, and I feel like I'm being left out!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1765]
Welcome, <playername>.
How're you doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1766]
Hey, <playername>. Question:
Do you think Cliff's truly happy now?<wait><page>
I feel like maybe he's too tied down.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1767]
Man, it's rough without Dad around.
Oh, we close at 5:00 PM today, by the way!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1768]
Today's the anniversary of Mom's death.
I don't really remember her at all, but that's not true
for Dad, obviously...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1769]
How's married life, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1770]
How's married life, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1771]
What's it like having a husband?<wait><page>
It's tough to put my finger on why, but just being with
family really makes you feel at ease, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1772]
Isn't it nice to go home and have a lovely wife waiting
for you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1773]
Hey there, <playername>.
How's your husband?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1774]
Hey there, <playername>.
How's your wife?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1775]
Make sure you tell 'em Ran says hi.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1776]
Make sure you tell 'em Ran says hi.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1777]
Hey, <playername>.
You look like you're working hard.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1778]
Hey, <playername>.
You look like you're working hard.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1779]
Isn't it nice having a husband around?<wait><page>
When you're single, you have to take care of everything
yourself, and we all know that's just the worst.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1780]
Having a wife around makes all your hard work worth it,
huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1781]
Marriage, huh? Dunno why, but I find it kinda
embarrassing to talk about.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1782]
Dad got mad at me for having my head in the clouds when
I was supposed to be working.<wait><page>
But I can't help it, y'know?
I've got STUFF to think about, <playername>!
THINGS!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1783]
Hey, welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1784]
If you're here to order food, go talk to my dad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1785]
Oh, welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1786]
Make yourself at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1787]
I'm not much of a girly girl.
Dad's always chiding me for that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1788]
But I'm proud of the person I am, and I love my dad for
raising me to express myself freely.<wait><page>
Even if I never find love, I don't really care.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1789]
Welcome. How's life on the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1790]
Having a farm nearby means our menu will always
feature super-fresh ingredients. Oh, to eat delicious food
every day! ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1791]
Oh, <playername>!
Welcome. Make yourself at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1792]
Oh, <playername>!
Welcome. Make yourself at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1793]
Hey, d'you think there's some unwritten rule that girls
have to be all cutesy? Sometimes I wonder...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1794]
Oh...
W-Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1795]
I've had a lot on my mind recently,
so I keep accidentally breaking plates.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1796]
...Hm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1797]
Oh, sorry.
Uh... Do you need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1798]
Sometimes, during slow periods, none of the guest rooms
are occupied. It's like a ghost town--er, ghost inn?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1799]
When I was little and there wasn't anyone staying with
us, I'd always ask if I could sleep in the guest rooms.<wait><page>
There was something so novel about it for me back then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1800]
Morning. You're already hard at work this early?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1801]
Yikes. That's rough.
Guess I'd better kick it into gear too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1802]
I've gotta clean the room before Cliff gets back from
work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1803]
Yeah, he's still staying in a guest room here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1804]
I LIVE TO CLEAN. The irony is that cleaning often
makes me dirty instead, but then I get to take a nice,
hot bath!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1805]
Business is booming lately.
Having so many folks around is great!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1806]
What're you doing here at this time of day?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1807]
Well, yeah, we have vacancies, but you're not about to
stay here overnight, are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1808]
The Goddess Hot Spring is good for your body.
Apparently, there're a ton of negative ions in the
morning!<wait><page>
The waterfall is a solid spot too!
That's what Marie was saying, at least.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1809]
All right, time to put my nose to the grindstone!
I hope we get a lot of guests today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1810]
Aah... I'm so happy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1811]
If you're looking for Cliff, I think he's still in his room.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1812]
Huh? Well, hey!
Fancy seeing you here, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1813]
Huh? Well, hey!
Fancy seeing you here, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1814]
Nothing beats a lungful of that early morning
mountain air!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1815]
I'm gonna eat SO MUCH mochi at tomorrow's Mochi
Bonanza! They won't have to worry about any leftovers,
heh heh heh.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1816]
Hey! Are you entering the Spring Derby? I'm definitely
gonna be there!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1817]
Tomorrow's the Derby! Just thinking about it is making
me giddy!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1818]
I'm kinda hoping this year's Cooking Exhibition theme has
to do with eggs, 'cause I'm an expert at cooking with
them. But who knows...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1819]
It's finally time for the Cooking Exhibition! I've gotta
whip something up that does our inn's name justice!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1820]
Oh, that's right, the Concert's coming up... I've gotta get
serious about practicing. I don't wanna make Elly have to
cover for me...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1821]
Tomorrow's Concert is gonna be PERFECTION!
...Or that's what I'm hoping. Still! I'm sure it'll all
work out...somehow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1822]
I'm so excited for the Fireworks Festival tomorrow!
How 'bout you, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1823]
I'm still trying to figure out what I want to bring to this
year's Harvest Festival...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1824]
Hey, <playername>! Let's have a great time
at tomorrow's Harvest Festival!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1825]
The moon during autumn is such a pretty sight!
I'm so ready for tomorrow's Moonlight Night!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1826]
Geez, this year sure went by fast. It's a little sad that
it's almost over, but we'll just have to eat the old year
away with some soba noodles!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1827]
Today's m'birthday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1828]
Oh my! Now, don't that look finger-lickin' good? Hm?

Much obliged.<wait>

Much obliged.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1831]
Erm... Sorry, but this ain't my cup o' tea.
Not by a long shot.<wait><page>
Ah well. It's the thought that counts an' all.
I won't toss it or nothin'.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1832]
What, did I do somethin' bad to you without realizin' it?
Gettin' this as a gift feels like a slap in the face!<wait><page>
If you have somethin' to say, how about you just say it,
huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1833]
Aww, what a sweet li'l thing.
There, there. That's a good critter.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1834]
What in the name of unseasoned skillets were
you thinkin'?! If you're doin' this on purpose,
then I tell you what...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1835]
Oh my! This is for me? But I couldn't possibly accept
somethin' this fancy.<wait><page>
I'm plenty happy with just the thought...
Really? Are you sure?<wait><page>
Well, if you insist... I'll just, er, forget t'mention this

Hm? This is what y'all use to make marriage proposals
'round here?<wait><page>
You don't say. How romantic! I take it you're off to
propose to your sweetheart, then?<wait><page>
Best of luck. I'm rootin' for ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1839]
One of my neighbors back in Forgotten Valley is a born
angler if I ever saw one.<wait><page>
I mean it. You'd be shocked at just what that rascal can
reel in with a fishin' rod and a bit of bait.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1840]
Seein' all the ingredients you have here in Mineral Town
is givin' me the itch whip up somethin' tasty.<wait>

Oh, and one more thing: even though you'll whip this up in
the kitchen, it ain't edible! Remember that.<wait>

You'll need a Cucumber, Cabbage, Carrot, and a Tomato.

I'm talkin' about.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1855]
Well, hey there, <playername>.
What's shakin'?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1856]
Everybody here in Mineral Town is just so nice! I haven't
found a bad apple yet. They're always sweet an' polite.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1857]
Ever heard of Forgotten Valley, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1858]
Me an' my hubby, we traveled the world, but Forgotten
Valley was just so nice we couldn't help but settle there.<wait><page>
YOU go out and see the world, then tell me there's
a nicer place than Forgotten Valley. Go on. I dare ya.
Haha!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1859]
Nothin' gets my heart pumpin' like makin' tasty food.
Well, and sharin' it. That's the secret to makin' friends.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1860]
If I stick around here in Mineral Town too long, I'm gonna
eat myself t'death. There's just too much good food here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1861]
Greetings! You a sightseer?
Wait, you say you moved to this town?<wait><page>
Nature's bounty is abundant here--quite unlike the
lifeless air of large cities--so I'm sure you'll love it here.<wait><page>
Hm? Me? Oh, that's right. Introductions.
I'm Basil.<wait><page>
As an enthusiast of all things botanical, I study the plants
here in Mineral Town. Nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1862]
Wow, thanks!<wait><page>
I don't know what to say.
Who told you it was my birthday?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1863]
Hey, thanks.
You know exactly what I like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1864]
Thanks.
Everyone in this town is so kind.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1865]
Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1866]
Urgh, my allergies are acting up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1867]
Huh? If you're looking for a recycling bin, you won't find
one here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1868]
Flora may be my specialty, but fauna makes me equally
happy; animals, insects, you name it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1869]
And here I thought you knew me better than that. Could
you kindly get that as far away from me as possible?
Now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1870]
Ahahaha, this is embarrassing. I don't make a habit of
giving Anna gifts like this, but if you insist...<wait><page>
I'll try giving it to her. Thanks for the tip.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1871]
Thanks. I'll try giving it to Anna.
I'm sure she'll love it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1872]
This has a nice scent.
I can tell it's all-natural, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1873]
Hey, thanks. I got some from Anna first thing this
morning, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1874]
Oh, that's right.
Do you grow any fruit on your farm?<wait><page>
I'll teach you how to make a Fruit Smoothie, so get your
pen and paper ready.<wait><page>
All you need is Fruit Juice and Milk! You simply put those
two in a Mixer, and voilà: Fruit Smoothie.<wait><page>
Huh? You want to know how to make Fruit Juice?
I'm afraid that's beyond the realm of my expertise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1875]
Ah... What a fascinating local custom.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1876]
I heard there's a plant in Forgotten Valley named Tartan
that can selectively breed other plants.<wait><page>
It was apparently created when some scientist
experimented with fusing plant and animal genes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1877]
I'd like to go see it once.
Wouldn't you as well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1878]
Is there anything you want to ask me? If it's within my
realm of knowledge, I'll gladly educate you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1879]
Oh, that so? Well, despite appearances, I'm actually
working even as we speak.<wait><page>
Sorry I can't be of more help.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1880]
Delightful weather we're having!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1881]
Humans and plants aren't so different.
Both exhibit depressive symptoms when they're not
exposed to enough sunlight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1882]
Plants have a sort of sixth sense, you know.
They can sense human emotions.<wait><page>
I'm currently writing a book on that very subject.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1883]
It's really coming down today!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1884]
Humans and plants alike will wither if overexposed
to harsh sunlight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1885]
Plants have incredible vitality.<wait><page>
Even an ancient seed can still sprout with enough
water and sunlight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1886]
Hey, <playername>. How's <childname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1887]
I can't wait to bring <childname> to the mountain.
Don't you think that'll make for a great learning
experience?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1888]
Mother's Hill is home to a considerable variety of plants.<wait><page>
Incidentally, that biological diversity is precisely why we
came to this town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1889]
There are many plants that only grow here in this town
and nowhere else.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1890]
Are you raising crops or flowers?<wait><page>
I'd love to have a field like you do, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1891]
Are you raising crops or flowers?<wait><page>
I'd love to have a field like you do, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1892]
I'm so busy writing that I don't have the time to go out
and study plants at the moment. Ironic, isn't it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1893]
The weather is gorgeous today!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1894]
Hey, <playername>. Are you done working?<wait><page>
Now, now. Moderation is key. If you don't pace yourself,
you'll be on the road to burnout before you know it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1895]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1896]
Nothing beats a day outside with the sun on your face
and the wind in your hair!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1897]
Plants change so much in just a week's time.
That's especially true for when it rains or snows.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1898]
Today's my favorite day of the week, bar none!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1899]
They say that if you do what you love, you'll never work
a day in your life, but now that I'm DOING it...<wait><page>
...I only have time to be outdoors one day a week.
Oh cruel, cruel world...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1900]
The people in this town sure know how to prepare a
tasty, satisfying beverage! That's why I'm always so spry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1901]
Mineral Town has wonderfully clean air, encouraging
healthy plant growth and making delicious ingredients
in turn!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1902]
Are you much of a gourmet, <playername>?<wait><page>
Marie won't so much as touch her plate if someone else is
watching. She hardly eats in the first place, honestly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Marie won't so much as touch her plate if someone else is

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1904]
Marie seems interested in plants herself, but I wish she'd
approach things with a little more...pizazz.<wait><page>
If only she was as passionate as you are.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1905]
I'm glad that my Library is useful to the townspeople.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1906]
It really helps that Marie is taking charge of it. That
way, I can focus on my research without distractions.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1907]
What kinds of plants are you cultivating in your field,
<playername>?<wait><page>
I'd like to go see them sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1908]
Plants need an appropriate amount of water and
fertilizer.<wait><page>
Tend to them once a day, and you'll be in botanical
business. Don't let the poor things go thirsty, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1909]
What kinds of crops are you cultivating these days,
<playername>?<wait><page>
If you have the chance, I'd love it if you could show me
sometime!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1910]
Ah, by the way, isn't the Moo-Moo Festival coming up?
I'm sure we'll have some udder-ly spectacular
participants this year! Haha!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1911]
I wonder, <playername>! Will you be entering your
best bovine in this year's Moo-Moo Festival?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1912]
Yet another year, come and gone... Let's celebrate it with
plenty of soba noodles tomorrow!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1913]
Oh, are you the one taking over the farm?
Thomas told me about you.<wait><page>
My name is Marie.
It's nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1914]
Wow, thank you.<wait><page>
It's so considerate of you to give me a gift on my
birthday, <nickname>. I love it.<wait>

[1916]
Wow, thank you.<wait><page>
It's so considerate of you to give me such a wonderful
gift on my birthday, <nickname>. I love it.<wait>

A birthday present?
Thank you.<wait>

[1918]
Oh! A present for me?!<wait><page>
Thank you. Papa only ever gives me books for my
birthday, so this is a nice change of pace.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1919]
Wow, thank you. This is perfect.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1920]
Oh, thank you!
Is it really okay for me to have this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

This is great.<wait>

[1925]
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1926]
Oh... Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1927]
This is for cooking, right?
I ask because I don't eat this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1928]
Mmm... I don't know what to say.
I'm not especially fond of that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1929]
Ah, I...I'd rather not accept that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1930]
Um.
Am I...missing something here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1931]
Hee hee! So cute!
I'm talking about you, <nickname>. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Ahahaha! How precious.
I'm grateful to live amongst so many animals in this town.<wait>

...Ah!
*staaare*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Thank you. This is made from the spoils of one of your
mining trips, right, <nickname>?<wait><page>
Knowing that you had a hand in creating it makes me
even happier.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1936]
Oh, for me?
Are you sure?<wait><page>
This is an accessory that Gray's grandfather made,
correct?<wait><page>
I wonder if Gray will make one for me someday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1937]
Thank you.
Hmm...<wait><page>
This accessory really piques my interest. I've never seen
this stone before.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1938]
Thank you! I can't imagine how costly this must have
been.<wait><page>
I'm so glad I married you, <nickname>. You have a

You're giving this to me?<wait><page>
Oh, I've been wanting this ever so much!
I'll treasure it. ♪<wait>

Getting perfume from my wife is a completely foreign

Hm. Maybe I'll try writing a romance novel next.<wait>

[1945]
Oh, this perfume, it's...! Well, I'm afraid I only know it by
name, not scent. That changes now. Thank you.<wait>

[1946]
Huh? Wait, if I'm not mistaken, today is... Ahem.
Well, th-thank you anyway. I'll happily accept it.<wait>

[1949]
Wow, thank you.<wait><page>
I didn't give you anything on Valentine's Day, did I?<wait><page>
I'll have to rectify that next year.
Do look forward to it!<wait>

[1950]
Thank you! These holidays make for excellent
opportunities to express our appreciation for
one another.<wait>

[1951]
O-Oh! Oh my goodness! W-Wait a moment.
Let's go to your house, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1952]
Wow, congratulations. That's big news.<wait><page>
But you should propose to that special person first
before coming to show that to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1953]
Hmm. This is a Blue Feather, correct?<wait><page>
Isn't that used to symbolize a marriage proposal?<wait>

If you don't have any plans for Starlight Night, would you
like to come to my house?<wait><page>
Mama makes the best cakes.<wait>

All right, I'll see you tomorrow, then.
Don't forget.<wait>

O-Oh, so you're busy.
No, please don't worry about it.<wait>

[1960]
When I first got the news, I nearly dropped the book
I was reading. But now I can't stop smiling.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1961]
Another life resides within my belly. The mere thought
sends me reeling--in a good way, of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1962]
Two hearts beat within me now.
Can you hear two heartbeats? I can't hear the baby's
myself. What about you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1963]
My belly grows by the day. Given my size, I'm sure
I'll have a healthy baby.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1964]
Mama told me she didn't get this big when she was
pregnant with me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1965]
The baby could be born as soon as tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1966]
In any case, it seems our baby is eager to meet Mama
<playername>. Do stay with me tomorrow, okay?
Please?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1967]
In any case, it seems our baby is eager to meet Papa

Don't you think our baby is growing up fast?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1972]
Ahaha... I'm already becoming a doting mother.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1973]
No book could have prepared me for how difficult it is to
raise a child. Theory and reality are quite different.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1974]
Though I certainly can't argue that children look like
angels when they're sleeping. Our little cherub...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1975]
Isn't it amazing? Walking already...
I'm almost at a loss for words. *sniffle*<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1976]
Even after taking a tumble, <childname> doesn't
cry. I take pride in being Mama to such an unflappable
child.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1977]
<childname> recently started talking.
I wonder if there's a book that can teach me how
to understand toddlers.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1978]
Papa said he can't wait to go on a trip to the mountain
with us.<wait><page>
If we're not careful, he'll snatch <childname> away
and spoil the poor thing rotten.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1979]
I feel like you've been rather cold to me recently.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1980]
I'm glad you're hard at work, but please make some time
to talk with me once in a while.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1981]
Good morning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1982]
No, I'm not angry.
It's...nothing, really.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1983]
I need to make food.
I'll talk to you later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1984]
I'll be honest. I'm struggling right now. I'm making this for
you, <nickname>, so please don't bother me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1985]
Do your best out there today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1986]
I suppose I'm more suited to working at the Library
after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1987]
However bookish you may or may not be,
<nickname>, it's very important work to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1988]
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1989]
Give it your all today!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1990]
Now that we're married, I'm feeling more inspired
to write than ever. Aha! Another novel idea!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1991]
Now that we're married, I'm feeling more inspired

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1992]
I can't talk about it right now, but I might show you once
I'm finished.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1993]
Good morning! Every day feels like an exciting new
chapter in the story of our life together,
<playername>. ∀<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[1995]
I don't think anyone else understands me the way you do. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1996]
Hm?
Are you hungry already?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1997]
I suppose all that physical exertion helps you work
up an appetite.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1998]
Oh, <nickname>.
You came.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[1999]
Don't worry.
I won't lift anything heavy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2000]
I'm glad I can continue working even after becoming
a mother.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2001]
What?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2002]
I'm busy right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2003]
What is it? Please keep your voice down in the Library.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2004]
What about your work? If you're looking for something
to do, go read a book over there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2005]
Oh, you're here.
I'm all right. My work is going well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2006]
Thank you for letting me remain the town librarian.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2007]
Oh, <nickname>.
Did you come to read some books?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2008]
Huh? You came to see how I was doing?
Oh, come now. I'm not a child.<wait><page>
Still...thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2009]
Welcome, <nickname>. There isn't anyone else who
loves books like you do.<wait>

[2010]
Ahaha... I suppose I should've expected nothing less from
my lovely husband. ♪<wait>

my lovely wife. ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2012]
Oh, hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2013]
Gray is really easy to talk with.
Maybe it's because we read the same books.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2014]
Hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2015]
Even though Gray and I are married now, our lives
haven't changed much at all.<wait><page>
I work at the Library, and Gray trains at the Forge. The
more things change, the more they stay the same.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2016]
Oh, hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2017]
Gray and Papa seem to be getting along really well, so
that's a relief.<wait><page>
Gray's grandfather is very kind as well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2018]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
Did you come to read some books?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2019]
When Gray comes back home, he always makes a show of
declaring that he's going to quit his training.<wait><page>
But the next day, he acts like nothing's happened.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2020]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
How is the farm coming along?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2021]
Not too long ago, we went to visit Gray's parents.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2022]
They were happy to hear that Gray has learned to love
books.<wait><page>
But I get the feeling that they would like him to take
interest in other things as well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2023]
Oh, <playername>! What are you doing?
I suppose you must've come to read.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2024]
You seem to love books, <playername>.<wait><page>
I'm glad to see more people taking an interest in reading.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2025]
Hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2026]
You seem to be doing well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2027]
How is the farm, <playername>?
Are you keeping busy?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2028]
What is it like to be married?<wait><page>
As much as I'd like to write a novel on the subject, I don't
know much about it. Would you mind educating me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2029]
Is life easier now that you're married?
Having someone special to come home to must be
a weight off your shoulders.<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[2030]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
How are things going with your husband?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2031]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
How are things going with your wife?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2032]
I imagine you make for a wonderful spouse,
<playername>.<wait><page>
You have so much to teach.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2033]
Tell your wife that I'll drop by for a visit sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2034]
Hee hee hee...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2035]
Oh, I'm positively over the moon.
Our wedding is fast approaching.<wait><page>
I've always dreamed of wearing a wedding dress,
and here that dream is about to come true.
I'm counting the days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2036]
Oh, I'm positively over the moon.
Our wedding is fast approaching.<wait><page>
I've always dreamed of wearing a wedding dress,
and here that dream is about to come true.

<------------------------------------------------------->
[2037]
Hello.<wait><page>
This Library was built so that the townspeople could
read Papa's books.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2038]
I sometimes switch out books or add new titles
to the collection, so I hope you make a habit
of stopping by often.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2039]
Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2040]
This town feels like a quaint fairy tale hamlet nestled in
the countryside.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2041]
Hello.
Are you enjoying your life on the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2042]
Would you tell me all about what a farmer does
sometime?<wait><page>
You came all the way to this town only to undertake a
life of hard labor... I imagine I could learn a lot from you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2043]
Oh, hello there! Your voracious appetite
for the written word is admirable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2044]
I love the scent of books.
They smell like...a forest, almost.
It transports me to a place of calm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2045]
Oh... Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2046]
Ah, no, I was simply lost in thought. I notice that only
certain people ever come to the Library.<wait><page>
And yet I dearly want to foster a passion for reading in
all of Mineral Town's residents.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2047]
Oh, hello there.
You're starting to be a familiar face!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2048]
I want to keep working here, even if I get married.<wait><page>
As long as people come to the Library, I want to be here
to greet them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2049]
Hello... Rrrgh.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2050]
What is wrong with me? I can't explain this strange
feeling welling up inside my chest.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2051]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
The Library is closed on Thursdays, just so you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2052]
I like to climb to the top of Mother's Hill on sunny
afternoons.<wait><page>
Saibara comes here in the morning, too, but I guess Gray
doesn't like to tag along.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2053]
On Thursdays when the weather is bad, we go to Gray's
grandfather's place instead.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2054]
Oh, <playername>.
What's the matter?
Do you need something from Gray?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2055]
You're always doing so much for Gray. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2056]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
The Library is closed today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2057]
Once a week on Mondays, we hike up to Mother's Hill
as a family so I can help my Papa.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2058]
Oh, <playername>. You won't find me
on the mountain in this kind of weather, but
I'm afraid the Library is still closed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2059]
I mean, even if I opened it, no one would
come anyway.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2060]
Oh, <playername>. What's the matter?
Is there a book you'd like to read?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2061]
The Library is usually open from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.
I look forward to seeing you the next time you come by.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2062]
Good morning.
It's the start of a beautiful new day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2063]
Are you enjoying life on the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2064]
Oh, hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2065]
Try not to catch a cold, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2066]
Hello. I'm afraid it's that dreadful day of the week when
the Library is closed: Thursday. I know, I know. Sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2067]
The Library is closed today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2068]
Once a week, we come to Mother's Hill as a family
so we can help my Papa.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2069]
Hello. The Library is closed today, I'm afraid.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2070]
Oh, what a coincidence.
I'm running errands for Mama today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2071]
Mama always buys too much. My arms aren't cut out
to carry it all home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2072]
Oh, if it isn't <playername>.
Are you on a botanical survey as well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2073]
Papa brings me and Mama out to the mountain even
in the winter.<wait><page>
I'm grateful that he can dig deep within and find some
discretion when it's snowing outside, at least.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2074]
Oh, hello. Coming to the mountain with Gray makes for a
much more enjoyable outing than my trips with Papa. <wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2075]
When I come with Papa, we're so fixated on what's
growing out of the ground that we neglect to appreciate
the scenery.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2076]
A blacksmith's job is very difficult. I can't imagine
handling fire every day. The mere thought gets my heart
pounding.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2077]
I enjoy visiting Gray's grandfather.<wait><page>
My parents can be a little absent-minded, so I'm jealous
of Gray's comparatively down-to-earth family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2078]
Ah, that's right! The Moo-Moo Festival is in just a few
days, isn't it? There'll be cows a-plenty there!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2079]
Tomorrow's Moo-Moo Festival is sure to be a good time!
Perhaps the winning cow will even inspire a story out of
me...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2080]
I do hope you'll join us at the Concert. We have such fun
every year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2081]
Goodness, the Concert's tomorrow! I hope I'll be able to
play well enough...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2082]
The Fireworks Festival is tomorrow. It's quite a lovely
sight to behold. It really does stir the heart.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2083]
Oh, I wonder what I should take with me to the
Harvest Festival...?<wait><page>
I've got to take something truly appetizing.
I want to make sure my ingredient counts!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2084]
The Harvest Festival meal incorporates ingredients of all
kinds... Unfortunately, that doesn't necessarily mean the
final product will be a five-star meal.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2085]
Will you be headed to tomorrow's Moonlight Night,
<playername>? I personally can't wait to go
moon gazing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2086]
Do you have a horse in this Derby, <playername>?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2087]
Tomorrow's the Derby, is it? I've been debating over
whether to buy tickets or not...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2088]
What a year it's been... I hope you'll join us at the
countdown tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2089]
May I tell you about a rumor I've heard?<wait><page>
Supposedly, there's a book out there that engrosses its
readers so much, they lose all sense of time!<wait><page>
If a book like that really does exist, I'd love to read it,
even just once...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2090]
I've heard another rumor regarding that time-consuming
book, <playername>.<wait><page>
Apparently, it can suddenly appear on your bookshelf
while you're not looking. Mysterious, isn't it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2091]
I've heard yet another rumor, <playername>.<wait><page>
Do you remember that mysterious book I was telling you
about? It's not the only one--there are several types,
apparently! I wonder what genres they are...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2092]
Hello there. Goodness, we haven't met before, have we?
...Ah, so you're the one who just moved into that farm?<wait><page>
Speaking of which, I seem to recall Thomas mentioning
something along those lines.<wait><page>
My name is Anna. I hope you'll come to enjoy life
in our cozy little town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2093]
Hm? Are you quite sure?<wait><page>
Usually, it's only my family that celebrates my birthday.
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2094]
Thank you! I'm absolutely delighted.
You make gift-giving an art form.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2095]
Oh, my! What a considerate gift.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2096]
Thank you. I'm rather fond of this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2097]
Hmmm. I...don't particularly like this. But since you're
offering, I suppose it would be rude not to take it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2098]
Absolutely NOT.
What is the meaning of this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2099]
Aw. How cute. Basil is always going on about how plants
are "cute" too, but I can't say I see it the way he does.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2100]
Why would you show me such a thing?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2101]
My, this is just lovely. What brand is it?
...It doesn't have a brand, you say?<wait><page>
The...blacksmith made it?
Then it's Saibara-brand, isn't it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2102]
Oh, my. Thank you. It's funny--I was just thinking about
how much I wanted something like this.<wait><page>
You truly understand what women want, unlike a certain
husband of mine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2103]
Oh, what a lovely fragrance. I hear this is all the rage
with the youth lately. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2104]
My, my. A bona fide Blue Feather.
I wish I'D been proposed to with one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2105]
Oh, <playername>. How is <childname>?
I can't wait to visit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2106]
That Basil, I swear. His enthusiasm for taking
<childname> to the mountain couldn't have a
clearer agenda.<wait><page>
He's determined to make our grandchild into a botanist.
"Plant a seed and see what grows," they say...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2107]
Hello, <playername>. Have you had a chance to read
any of Basil's books?<wait><page>
The Library is positively overflowing with texts
he's written.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2108]
Market trends favor town guides over specialized books
like Basil's botanical encyclopedias.<wait><page>
That fact gives him no small amount of grief. His books
may be helpful to you, though, so give them a read.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2109]
Oh, <playername>! A long-lost memory just came
back to me.<wait><page>
Once, when we went to the mountain, Basil was so
absorbed in looking at flowers that he fell off a cliff.<wait><page>
Isn't that simply hysterical?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2110]
My husband is always sneaking off to the Inn for evening
libations. Bit of a freewheeling sort of man, isn't he?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2111]
Oh, my. Good morning, <playername>. Hard at work
again today? I can't imagine how exhausting your
schedule must be.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2112]
Honestly, I'm a little envious of you, <playername>.<wait><page>
My circumstances are so dull that I spend every morning
thinking about how I'm going to spend yet another day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2113]
My, my. It's coming down hard today.
Poor Basil's probably feeling sullen.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2114]
Yesterday, I prayed that we'd have good weather today.
But when I woke up, well...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2115]
My prayer must have backfired somehow.
Talk about strange. Oh, but don't breathe
a word of this to Basil, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2116]
What should I do when I get home? Even if Basil ends up
being around, he'll no doubt be focused on work.
What a bore.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2117]
In the afternoon, all the wives in town gather at the
Plaza to gossip about this and that.<wait><page>
I truly look forward to catching up with everyone. Basil,
on the other hand... He only talks about plants. *sigh*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2118]
Oh! Hello, <playername>. It's good to see that you're
doing well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2119]
Today's my weekly shopping day. I always look forward
to seeing what the General Store has in stock.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2120]
Pots are an absolute necessity for cooking,
so I recommend buying one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2121]
Sasha's husband always seems so exhausted, yet Sasha
herself is completely unflappable.<wait><page>
I imagine it's hard work running a business.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2122]
And I certainly do NOT have a tab here. I simply forget
my wallet on occasion.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2123]
She what? Oh, my...
What a pity.
No, I...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2124]
Have you heard about Lillia's husband?<wait><page>
He went to find a desert flower--one that only blooms
once every ten years--in order to cure what ails Lillia.<wait><page>
Honestly, I'm a little jealous Lillia has such a devoted
husband, but she's been very lonely without him.<wait><page>
Perhaps I shouldn't have told her husband about
that flower...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2125]
We spend time together as a family by hiking up the
mountain on Mondays.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2126]
But all we talk about is research this, botany that....<wait><page>
I wish Marie at least would talk about her love life,
or...something! Anything that isn't scientific in nature!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2127]
Mother's Hill is full of things to find. I honestly do have
a good time up here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2128]
Maybe I'll make jam again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2129]
Marie's a little bookworm, so she gets along swimmingly
with her father.<wait><page>
I wish she'd talk to me a little more, though.
Mama needs some love too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2130]
What sorts of crops do you harvest from your field,
<playername>? I'd love to try home-grown produce
sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2131]
You know, I may complain about having nothing to do,
but living a laid-back country life was always my dream.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2132]
Basil's books are on the technical side, so they aren't
exactly at the top of everyone's shopping list.<wait><page>
For the sake of our family's livelihood, I wish he'd write
something a little more palatable, but I can't convince
him to.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2133]
The Harvest Festival gets closer by the day! Hm?
Am I looking forward to it? Of course!
Why wouldn't I be?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2134]
I can't wait to see the cornucopia of ingredients
everyone's going to bring to the Harvest Festival...
Hopefully we can make something tasty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2135]
It's almost time again for the Fluffy Festival, is it?
Are you thinking about entering, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2136]
I just adore Angora rabbits... I'm secretly hoping I'll get to
see one at this year's Fluffy Festival...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2137]
A new beginning may be on its way, but I'm only feeling
older... Such is life, I suppose!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2138]
I am Huang, merchant by trade and purveyor of fine
goods--THESE fine goods right here, in fact!<wait><page>
Quite a selection, yes?
Come look and buy what tickles you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2139]
<nickname>! You are giving this to me?!<wait><page>
Aah! You remembered my birthday!
I overflow with happiness. Xie xie!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2140]
Dear customer!
You delight me, truly!<wait><page>
Today is my birthday, yes? 
I humbly accept this most wonderful gift. Xie xie!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2141]
<nickname>! You are wonderful!<wait><page>
To give me something so pleasing as a present... Xie xie!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2142]
Aiyaaah! You are a good person, yes?
You have made me happy. Xie xie!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2143]
Aah, <nickname>! I love this! Xie xie!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2144]
Aah, many thanks.
I like this very much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2145]
Aah! <nickname>, many thanks.
I humbly accept your gift.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2146]
Many thanks. Xie xie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2147]
Hm? What IS this, <nickname>?
I will accept it, but I do not like it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2148]
Aiyaaah! This is no good, dear customer. No good at all.
What use have I for something like this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2149]
<nickname>, pranks are not good!
Not good at all.<wait><page>
Was your wish to agitate me? Hm?
What am I to do with this thing now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2150]
Dear customer, pranks are not good!
You may cause me to be angry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2151]
<nickname>, I see you adore animals.
Animals are splendid, wonderful things.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2152]
Do you like animals, dear customer?
I have good animals, yes? Secret animals, only for you.
Rare bugs, too!<wait><page>
Oh. Are you sure?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2153]
<nickname>, that is hardly worth any money.
Take it away now, please.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2154]
Dear customer, that is hardly worth any money.
Take it away now, please.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2155]
Aiyaaah! <nickname>, you are really giving this
to me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2156]
At the very least, it must be worth...
Factor in inflation, carry the two--we mustn't forget--
and...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2157]
Ah! No, no. I must keep it. It is mine, yes?
I will take good care of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2158]
Aiyaaah! Dear customer, you are giving this to me
for free?<wait><page>
I could sell this for quite the pretty pen-- Ahem. No, no.
I will keep it, yes? And take good care of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2159]
Aiyaaah! <nickname>, you are really giving this
to me?<wait><page>
This would be very popular with certain ladies, yes?
I think I could set a price of at lea-- Ahem!<wait><page>
No, no. I will keep it and take good care of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2160]
Aiyaaah! Dear customer, you are giving this to me
for free?<wait><page>
Certain ladies would pay a high price for thi-- Ahem.
No, no. I will keep it, yes? And take good care of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2161]
<nickname>! That! That is for me? Ooh, my
profits! They soar in my daydreams already!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2162]
Hm? For me? You are a most unselfish person,
<nickname>. Xie xie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2163]
Dear customer, I will gladly pay you a high price
for-- What? You will give it to me for free?<wait><page>
You are a most generous and unselfish person, my friend!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2164]
<nickname>, xie xie. I have been looking forward
to today for some time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2165]
Oh! You give this to me even though I gave you nothing for
White Day?<wait><page>
Xie xie. You delight me, truly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2166]
Oh, a return gift for White Day, yes? Many thanks.
Xie xie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2167]
For me? Erm, ah... P-Perhaps we should not discuss this
here, yes? Let us move to your house.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2168]
Good luck, dear customer. But should your fortune
be ill, I will buy that from you for a high price.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2169]
Tomorrow is Starlight Night, yes?
We will have a party.
Come home between 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2170]
<nickname>, no hustling about, yes? It is not good
for the baby in your tummy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2171]
Still, I had no clue that fatherhood would soon be upon me.
How prosperous in wealth will our child be, I wonder?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2172]
<nickname>, how do you feel?
You are not ill at all?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2173]
Tell me anything you need, yes?
A married couple helps one another.
That is the proper way of things.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2174]
Tell me anything you need, yes?
A married couple helps one another.
That is the proper way of things.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2175]
Today is White Day, yes?
But you still offer ME cookies?<wait><page>
Oh, you make me so very happy.
I am glad we are married. Xie xie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2176]
Today is White Day, yes?
But you still offer ME cookies?<wait><page>
Oh, you make me so very happy.
I am glad we are married. Xie xie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2177]
Does happiness smile upon the baby in your tummy?
I think you should be the one to name it,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2178]
I think our baby may be born soon, yes?
I can't wait for us to meet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2179]
<nickname>, Doctor and Nurse Elly will come
today. It seems the time has finally come.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2180]
I hope our baby is big and healthy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2181]
<childname> sleeps the day away.
But a sleepy child is a growing child, or so they say.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2182]
<childname> is very cute.
As cute as you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2183]
Has <childname> grown? I am sure it wasn't as
hard to lift the little one before...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2184]
I hope our baby becomes a merchant, like me. Then I can
sleep well knowing they will always make a good living.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2185]
I wonder when <childname> will learn to stand?
I think it may be soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2186]
I saw <childname> try to stand, even though we
have not taught the little one how. Amazing, yes?
Most amazing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2187]
Children grow up very quickly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2188]
I learn much from <childname> every day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2189]
I never imagined that one day I would be a Papa. But now
that I am one, I find I have taken to it gladly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2190]
I can't wait until <childname> learns speech.
My first lecture will be "a silver tongue begets
a gold wallet."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2191]
...Mm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2192]
I do not wish to speak to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2193]
Good morning.
You have not spoken to me much of late.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2194]
<nickname>, is something wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2195]
Welcome home.
Are you going back to work?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2196]
It is good to be passionate about work, but making time
for one's spouse... That is MORE good, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2197]
It is good to be passionate about work, but making time
for one's spouse... That is MORE good, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2198]
Good morning. Today is another day of working hard and
making money.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2199]
<nickname>, you'll work hard today too, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2200]
Welcome home.
Did you have a profitable day today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2201]
Hm? Did *I*? Well, that is a secret. Even to my spouse,
I will not say.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2202]
Good morning. Let us both work hard and bring home
good money today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2203]
Both spouses working means double the income, yes?
Please know that I will work hard so we can both live
well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2204]
Welcome home, <nickname>.
Did you rake in the profits today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2205]
There is so very much work to do on a farm.
It is a difficult life, yes?<wait><page>
But you do it well, <nickname>.
I have so much respect for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2206]
Good morning, <nickname>.
Did you sleep well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2207]
This house is very relaxing.
You have good feng shui, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2208]
<nickname>, welcome home.
Is all going well on the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2209]
Being a farmer must be your calling, yes?
You don't need the gift of gab to make money.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2210]
Aah. <nickname>. Come to shop?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2211]
Buy what you will buy and then leave.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2212]
Aah. <nickname>. Come to shop?
If you need it, I have it, guaranteed!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2213]
But business and private life, they are separate things,
yes? I will give no discount even if you are my wife.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2214]
But business and private life, they are separate things,
yes? I will give no discount even if you are my husband.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2215]
Looking for something, <nickname>?
Just ask and I will deliver.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2216]
I sell my wares at full price, even to you,
<nickname>. Business and pleasure are separate.
That is my policy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2217]
Aah! <nickname>, you are always welcome here.
Buy whatever you need.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2218]
Business is business, <nickname>. My honored
customer is my honored customer, even if they are my
wife.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2219]
Business is business, <nickname>. My honored
customer is my honored customer, even if they are my
husband.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2220]
<nickname>, you came to see me? Aah, I knew my
wife would do no less. Most considerate of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2221]
<nickname>, you came to see me? Aah, I knew my
husband would do no less. Most considerate of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2222]
I am happy to see you. I will be even more happy if you
buy something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2223]
Aah, <nickname>! I am glad to see you. Please, take
your time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2224]
Of course, time is money. I will not be happy if you skipped
work to see me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2225]
Aah, <nickname>! You came. Welcome, welcome.
Please, take your time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2226]
No honored customers have come today.
But YOU came, <nickname>.
That delights me, truly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2227]
Is something the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2228]
Whatever you may need, I stock it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2229]
What is the matter, <playername>?
Do not stand there like a withered money tree.
Buy something, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2230]
I dislike cheapskates and misers.
I prefer when honored customers gladly pay, no matter
how high the price.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2231]
<playername>! Welcome, welcome.
I am glad you came.
Please, take your time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2232]
Hmph. No customers have come today, yes?
Only you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2233]
Aiyaaah! You came all the way here?
Are you okay? Watch your step.
It is dangerous out there, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2234]
I am happy you came to get me, yes?
But it is dangerous here.
I worry you will trip and fall.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2235]
Is <childname> still at home?
And behaving?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2236]
I will come home at 6:00 PM, yes? I can't wait to see
<childname>'s little face.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2237]
May I help you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2238]
I am going home now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2239]
I am tired, yes? I would like to go home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2240]
I am tired, yes? Too tired to talk.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2241]
<nickname>, I am going home now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2242]
<nickname>, how much money did you make today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2243]
<nickname>, how is the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2244]
It is very nice to have land--I mean, a house, yes?
Most relaxing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2245]
<nickname>, you work very hard, yes?
I favor people who work hard.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2246]
You are my ideal wife, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2247]
You are my ideal husband, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2248]
Aiyah! <nickname>, what is wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2249]
It is not good to move around much while you have a baby
in your tummy, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2250]
Aiyaaah! What is <childname> doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2251]
I look away and the little one disappears.
So precocious, yes? Should I be worried?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2252]
I have no business with you.
I must go home now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2253]
<nickname>, is something wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2254]
Lately, I find we interact less.
Did I do something wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2255]
Oh, <nickname>, it is you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2256]
It is not wise to go out carrying too much money.
If it is in your pocket, you will want to spend it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2257]
<nickname>, have you found any good ways to
make money?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2258]
You are just as important as money to me,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2259]
Oh, <nickname>, it is you.
Is something wrong?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2260]
Together, we will make much money, yes? Marriage is our
path to luxury--to retirement spent in ease and bliss.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2261]
Together, we will make much money, yes? Marriage is our
path to luxury--to retirement spent in ease and bliss.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2262]
Aah, <playername>! I'd completely forgotten,
what with all of my mayoral duties...<wait><page>
Thank you for the reminder that today is my
birthday--by way of such a lovely present, to boot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2263]
Ohohoho! What a splendid present!
You've discovered my weak spot, you rascal.
Thank you kindly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2264]
Oh ho! What have we here?
Aah, splendid, splendid!
I do so enjoy these. Thank you kindly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2265]
How very kind of you.
I am always appreciative of presents.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2266]
Oh ho? What have we--
Erm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2267]
Oh ho! ...A-Ah, now what am I to do with this? I see that
you have decided to, erm...test me, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2268]
Oh ho! It's no surprise that a farmer of your caliber is
accustomed to handling all sorts of animals and insects.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2269]
AAAIIIEEE!
Heeeeelp!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2270]
Well, well! A mighty fine item indeed!<wait><page>
Thank you kindly. You know, if Harris ever decides to
marry, I think I may give this as a gift to his spouse.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2271]
Well, isn't THIS quite the fashionable item! Hm?
You intended it to be a gift for me?<wait><page>
A lovely thought, no doubt, but I'm afraid I have no use
for it. Perhaps I will gift it to Harris' future spouse.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2272]
Well, isn't THIS quite the fashionable item! Does the
scent not disturb your animals when you wear it, though?<wait><page>
Hm? You intended it as a gift for me? How thoughtful!
Thank you kindly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2273]
Aah, most kind of you! Valentine's Day loses its sheen if
you don't receive chocolates at least once, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2274]
Aah, most kind of you! Valentine's Day loses its sheen if
you don't receive chocolates at least once, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2275]
Ohohoho! Wonderful news, my friend! Wonderful
news indeed! I am certain you have a bright future
ahead of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2276]
<playername>, have you heard of Forgotten Valley?<wait><page>
This is only a rumor, mind you, but I hear that a resident
farmer there is a local celebrity.<wait><page>
I would like to meet this person someday...and perhaps
shake their hand, should they be sufficiently
magnanimous.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2277]
Some years ago, I shared my roof with a gentleman by
the name of Kanno.<wait><page>
He was a photographer, you see. Had a real fondness for
taking pictures of Mineral Town's scenery.<wait><page>
But one day, I returned home to find he had left, leaving
behind only a letter. I wonder where he is now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2278]
By Jove, you've done it! You have won our venerable
Cooking Exhibition ten times! As mayor, I couldn't be
prouder!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2279]
Now, this is only a rumor I heard from the mayor of
a neighboring town the other day...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2280]
But apparently, word of your excellence in our illustrious
Cooking Exhibition has reached even Forgotten Valley.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2281]
<playername>, I hear you bested even a professional
chef as part of your culinary conquest. Most impressive!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2282]
Hmph. Play innocent all you like--you will not fool me.
I can see straight through you, you know.<wait><page>
What were you thinking, trying to sneak behind my back
like that? Have you no respect for my mayoral station?!<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[2283]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2284]
So, you insist upon feigning ignorance?
You are aware that the ENTIRE WORLD
is talking about you, are you not?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2285]
What? You have done nothing? No, no. Surely you jest.
You MUST have done something. What was it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2286]
Wait...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2287]
No... NO!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2288]
Egads! It couldn't be!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2289]
Are you plotting to usurp my position as mayor of
Mineral Town?! No! I will not have it, you hear?
I will NOT have it!<wait><page>
My family has served this town for generations!
I REFUSE you the latitude to besmirch our good name!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2290]
Hm? You were plotting no such thing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2291]
Oh! O-Of course not! Ohohoho! You would never do such a
thing. No, not you! I never believed it for a second.<wait><page>
Splendid! Splendid indeed!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2292]
Now, then...what were we talking about?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2293]
<playername>, you are a nonpareil of Mineral Town
excellence! Truly a model citizen!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2294]
Hrm? What do I mean? Oh, come now!
There is no need to feign humility.<wait><page>
After all, you put the kibosh on a WAR! Tired of all the
fighting, you appealed to the two countries'
representatives...<wait><page>
...and then melted their hearts with handmade dishes
originating from their hometowns. Or so I hear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2295]
The representatives were so moved by your cooking that
they called a cease-fire on the spot. Or so I was told.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2296]
Aaah, what a splendid story! I've always had a weakness
for such tales of courage and selflessness.<wait><page>
They tug on my heartstrings like you would not believe.
When I caught wind of your glorious deeds...
Oh, how I wept!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2297]
<playername>, you are a hero who has saved the
peoples of not one, but TWO entire countries.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2298]
Three cheers for <playername>!
Huzzah! Huzzah! HUZZAAAH!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2299]
Word is that you are preparing to leave on a journey to
collect legendary cooking ingredients.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2300]
I've always hoped I might one day have the opportunity to
catch a glimpse of such culinary commodities.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2301]
Should you find one, I would be most honored if you'd
bring it to me. Don't worry. I will only touch with my eyes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2302]
Aah...! I can only imagine how superlative those
ingredients must be to have earned their "legendary"
moniker!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2303]
Hm? Is something the matter?
You are giving me a most quizzical look.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2304]
Wh-What? You are planning no such thing? Oh, come, now!
There is no need to hide it from me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2305]
...Ohhh!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2306]
Ahem. I understand. Your secret is safe with me. I will let
not one word of it pass my lips! You can trust me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2307]
I hear you went on a grand adventure to acquire
legendary ingredients!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2308]
You wandered through a deep jungle, forging
ahead--step by rough step--only to be attacked
by an indigenous tribe!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2309]
Kidnapped, you were tied to a pole and carted to their
village, where they forced you to cook for them, I heard.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2310]
But with one bite of your cooking, the tribe's rage
dissipated! They even conferred upon you a title, I believe.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2311]
Oh, what was it again? Erm... Oh, yes! They dubbed you
their "Grand Poobah"! Or so I was told.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2312]
I can't say I fully understand what that means,
but the whole endeavor sounds quite exhilarating.
Well met, Poobah!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2313]
I further heard that upon induction to their tribe,
they told you of the cave where the legendary
ingredients slept.<wait><page>
With a young lad of the tribe as your guide,
you courageously set forth to retrieve them!
...Or so the rumor says.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2314]
Yet unbeknownst to you, that perilous cave would be
fraught with all manner of insidious dangers!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2315]
A deluge of snakes, raining from above!
An infestation of scorpions, scuttling forth from
the inky depths!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2316]
Nevertheless, you braved that danger and reached
the cave's depths, wherein the legendary ingredients
awaited you!<wait><page>
Well, so I heard. Still, you had yourself quite an adventure,
especially for a farmer of your tender age.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2317]
Hm? Goodness, why are you giving me such a puzzled look?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2318]
Oh! Oh, yes! Fear not--your secret is safe with me.
I have not breathed a word of this to another soul.<wait><page>
No one will learn from me that you now possess the
legendary ingredients, oh, no. You have my word.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2319]
After all, I'm sure you want to keep it under wraps that
you had to fight you-know-who in a grand battle to the
death.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2320]
"You-know-who WHO," you say? Oh, come, now!
You are being coy yet again. You know exactly who
I speak of.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2321]
You were attempting to learn the Final Ultimate
Technique of Culinary Majesty, the--er, what was
it named again?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2322]
Anyway! *mumble* was a master of this technique, which
is why you sought *cough*'s tutelage, of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2323]
But in order to learn this technique, your final trial was
to defeat your teacher in one-on-one combat! Right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2324]
I can't seem to recall the particulars of that technique
at the moment, but was it worth all the grueling effort?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2325]
Erm, I'm afraid your silence does not tell me one way
or the other...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2326]
Oh! Ohhh! No, no. Say no more.<wait><page>
You do not wish to speak lightly of your master and the
ordeal you underwent together. I understand. Completely.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2327]
That...is what you meant. I'm sure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2328]
Message received. I shall speak of your revered master
no more.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2329]
No one shall learn of *mumble* from me--you can be
certain of that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2330]
<playername>, is it true that you vanquished the
Android Annihilator?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2331]
Why, the Android Annihilator is supposedly one of the
mightiest generals in the Evil Overlord's army!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2332]
To defeat such a terrifying foe with aplomb...
I always knew that you were a man destined for glory!
Yes, that I did!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2333]
...I mean, er, a great woman!
Yes, that's right. Slip of the tongue.
But more importantly!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2334]
With the Android Annihilator's defeat, the Evil Overlord
will surely bring his full might to bear against you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2335]
Please be ever so cautious when you are walking the
roads at night.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2336]
Though considering you defeated the Android Annihilator,
I doubt any danger will be too great for you to handle.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2337]
Some say that hidden deep within Forgotten Valley,
there lies the secret lair of the Evil Overlord.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2338]
Hoe in hand, a farmer clutches seed to breast, heroically
charging into that den and vanquishing its dark minions...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2339]
Your legend writes itself! Then you faced off against the
Overlord in one-on-one combat and defeated him with
ease...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2340]
No surprise at all, considering you learned the Final
Ultimate Technique from your master, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2341]
Simply standing before you is an honor. From now on,
I dub thee Master <playername>, Savior of the
World.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2342]
Master <playername>, Savior of the World, please
accept this token of our most humble and sincere
gratitude.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2343]
Master <playername>, Savior of the World, was that
token insufficient? Then please, take this as well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2344]
Ah, Master <playername>, Savior of the World,
a thousand humble pardons. I have displeased you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2345]
If my paltry offerings are not enough to demonstrate my
gratitude, what might I present to you to--<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2346]
Hm? You prefer NOT to be called Master
<playername>, Savior of the World?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2347]
You would rather I call you by your name, as I have
always done before?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2348]
If that is your wish, Master <playername>, Savior of
the World, I am bound and compelled to oblige...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2349]
Erm! I mean... Thy will be done, <playername>. Ack!
Take three! Ahem! Certainly, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2350]
And so yet another peaceful day passes in our peaceful
town. As mayor, I could not be happier.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2351]
Another day spent hard at work, <playername>?
It must be quite tiring. You could at least take the
weekend off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2352]
But I'm sure that is easier said than done for someone
with a farm to maintain, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2353]
Hrm. It does not seem like this will let up anytime soon.
And here I was hoping to take a stroll to the Plaza...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2354]
For me, there are few greater pleasures than spending
a weekend afternoon with Ellen over a piece of apple pie.<wait><page>
Both she and I are diehard devotees of the apple pie they
serve at the Inn. It is marvelously delicious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2355]
Good day, <playername>. I was just on my way to do
some shopping.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2356]
My, my! If it isn't <playername>.
Good day! How fares the farm?
Is all going well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2357]
No one is particularly good at a task when they try it
for the first time.<wait><page>
Doubly so when it is a task as complex as managing
a farm. It will take time to learn the ins and outs.
Have patience.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2358]
Good day to you, <playername>!
How fares the farm?
Have you acclimated to your new life?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2359]
I'm afraid I can't say much in regards to farms
and farming...<wait><page>
But I do mean to provide you all the assistance that I can
via other avenues.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2360]
A good day to you, <playername>!
I hear you are working hard on the farm.
How does it fare?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2361]
Oh ho! Is that so? I'm afraid I know little of the
nitty-gritty, but I DO know that our lives depend
on farmers.<wait><page>
Thank you very much for all that you do,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2362]
Good day, <playername>.
Are you taking a short rest too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2363]
No doubt the animals must feel invigorated on a beautiful
day like today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2364]
Good day, <playername>. How are you?
Does our humble Mineral Town feel more like home yet?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2365]
If you are in need of anything, do not hesitate to ask.
I will gladly help you in every way that I can.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2366]
Saps and seedlings, what a day!
Does it ever intend to let up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2367]
I was hoping to go to the Plaza if the weather would
cooperate. I cannot recall if I updated the notice board
or not.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2368]
Drat! Snowfall once again. I was hoping for a more
relaxing day off today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2369]
Harris generally comes to the Inn at this hour.
On climatically uncooperative days, I do the same.<wait><page>
It always makes me feel better when Harris tells me
that nothing problematic has happened in town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2370]
This Plaza is a place of peace, rest, and togetherness for
everyone in town.<wait><page>
I am never so glad to be mayor as when I come here on
festival days and reap the bounty of everyone's smiling
faces.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2371]
Are you enjoying the festival?<wait><page>
I'm delighted to see that you seem to be getting on well
with everyone in town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2372]
Good day, <playername>. Have you noticed how
diverse our community is here in Mineral Town?<wait><page>
When you befriend people of varied backgrounds, it
expands your worldview, making your life richer for it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2373]
How have you been, <playername>?
Is all going well?<wait><page>
Not that I need to ask. You have already cemented
yourself as a valued and respected member of our
community.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2374]
Tomorrow's our Mochi Bonanza. Keep working hard out
there, and build up that appetite for some tasty mochi!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2375]
Entering our Spring Derby this year, <playername>?<wait><page>
I hope you've made all the necessary preparations!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2376]
I hope you'll buy tickets at tomorrow's Derby! N-No,
I'm not just saying that because a percentage of ticket
proceeds will go towards our fair town!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2377]
If you're going to be whipping us up a dish for the Cooking
Exhibition, you'll have to prepare something extra special
to impress Bon Vivant.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2378]
Whenever the Cooking Exhibition comes 'round, simply
thinking of all the splendid culinary delights we'll be
seeing makes my mouth water!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2379]
Preparations for the Fetch Fest are so tiresome...
The heat tends to be unbearable this time of year,
but I must press on! For the adorable pets!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2380]
Is your pet competing in the Fetch Fest, as well?<wait><page>
I'm very much looking forward to seeing all our cute,
cuddly competitors tomorrow!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2381]
The Cluck-Cluck Clash looms upon us, <playername>!
Why not enter one of your feathered friends?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2382]
I wonder what kinds of chickens we'll see tomorrow?
Either way, I'm sure it'll be a clucking good time! Oho!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2383]
Why not enter a cow in the Moo-Moo Festival? I'm sure
the judge would be moooved by a cow from your farm!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2384]
Here's a Moo-Moo Festival fun fact: prize-winning cows
always have a unique sort of dignity to them! I hope you'll
attend tomorrow!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2385]
The Harvest Festival is in just TWO days! I'm counting on
you of all people to bring us a stellar ingredient!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2386]
I eagerly await this year's Harvest Festival! It warms
my heart to see our little ingredient collection
every year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2387]
Entering our Autumn Derby this year,
<playername>?<wait><page>
I hope you've made all the necessary preparations!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2388]
I hope you'll buy tickets at tomorrow's Derby! N-No,
I'm not just saying that because a percentage of ticket
proceeds will go towards our fair town!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2389]
Fluffy Festival fun fact for you: alpacas and Angora
rabbits are also eligible to compete!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2390]
Ahh, yes, the Fluffy Festival... Sheep, alpacas, Angora
rabbits...they're all welcome! I'm eager to see them all!<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2391]
Tomorrow's our Pumpkin Jamboree! It's guaranteed to
be a pumpkin-tastic time for us all!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2392]
The New Year's Party is closing in on us! I hope you'll
come ring in the new year with us.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2393]
Hello there. Oh, I haven't seen you around here before.
Did you move onto that farm?<wait><page>
Wow. That's impressive. Ah, I haven't introduced myself
yet, have I?<wait><page>
My name is Elly.
It's nice to meet you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2394]
Hello there. Oh, I haven't seen you around here before.
Did you move onto that farm?<wait><page>
Wow. That's impressive. Ah, I haven't introduced myself
yet, have I?<wait><page>
My name is Elly.
It's nice to meet you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2395]
Wow, a birthday present?
I'm so happy. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2396]
Thank you.
I'm always happy to get presents on my birthday,
no matter how old I get.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2397]
A birthday present?
Wow, is it really all right for me to have something
so luxurious?<wait><page>
Wasn't this expensive?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2398]
Hm? A birthday present?
Wow, I...I don't know what to say.
Are you sure? Thank you so much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2399]
Hm? This is for me?
Thank you for such a wonderful birthday present. Really.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2400]
Thank you, <nickname>.
I feel so fortunate to have a wife like you. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2401]
Thank you, <nickname>.
I feel so fortunate to have a husband like you. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2402]
Whoa! This is for me? Thank you.
I'm going to be smiling for the rest of the day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2403]
Thank you, <nickname>.
I honestly love it. You know me well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2404]
Thank you. I'm so happy.
But is it really all right for me
to receive something so...so...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2405]
Thank you! You're so kind to me, and yet I feel like I'm
always putting you through the wringer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2406]
Thank you. This is nice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2407]
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2408]
Huh? This is, um...
Did you keep the receipt, by chance?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2409]
I-I mustn't turn down an act of generosity... I'm always
telling Yu not to be picky, after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2410]
That is QUITE enough of that!
Why would you bring something like this to me
on purpose?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2411]
Why would you do this to me?
You're a horrible person!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2412]
Hmmm? Yeees?
Hee hee. Simply adorable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2413]
Positively precious.
Don't you think so, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2414]
Positively precious.
Don't you think so, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2415]
Eeek! Oh, grow up and stop playing tricks on people!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2416]
Eeek! What are you doing?!
Yu is rubbing off on you, and I don't like it one bit!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2417]
Thank you.
So, what about it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2418]
Huh? Are you sure? It looks so far out of my income
bracket...but thank you. I'll treasure it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2419]
Wow, you're giving this to me?
Thank you. I'll treasure it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2420]
Thank you so much.
Not even in my dreams did I imagine I'd receive such
a thoughtful gift.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2421]
Thank you.
This must've been pretty expensive, no?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2422]
Wow, simply wonderful.
And you're giving it to me as a gift?
Thank you very much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2423]
Perfume is wonderful. It can make you feel like a
completely different person. I'll try putting it on later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2424]
Thank you.
I'll definitely use this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2425]
I've...never once worn this in my life. Thank you for helping
one of my dreams come true. I'm so happy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2426]
It feels a little strange to receive cookies on this day,
but I'll take them. Thank you for being thoughtful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2427]
Hm? Today is Valentine's Day.
You're sure you meant to give this to me? Well, thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2428]
Thank you.
White Day cookies, I presume?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2429]
May I really have this?
Thank you. I apologize for not giving you anything
last year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2430]
Thank you.
You remembered to return the favor.
You're very conscientious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2431]
B-But I'm not emotionally prepared for this...
Before I get ahead of myself, let's go to your
house, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2432]
B-But I'm not emotionally prepared for this...
Before I get ahead of myself, let's go to your
house, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2433]
Oh my, are you going to propose?
Hee hee, best wishes for you and the lucky bride
or groom.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2434]
I want to continue helping Doctor for now. Forgive me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2435]
Oh, why are you suddenly taking that Preserved Flower
out? It would be a shame if you lost it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2436]
Will you come to my house tomorrow for
Starlight Night? Grandma and Yu would love
to see you too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2437]
I'll be cooking up a real feast, so I hope you come hungry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2438]
Oh, right. I understand.
I'm sure you have more than enough going on,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2439]
Oh, right. I understand.
I'm sure you have more than enough going on,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2440]
I'll be slaving away over a hot stove all day tomorrow to
prep for Starlight Night, so let's spend it together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2441]
I'm so happy. I've dreamed of motherhood for so long. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2442]
You should think of a name, <nickname>. ∀
Or am I being a little too hasty?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2443]
Good morning. The baby and I are both feeling wonderful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2444]
Women are so blessed. The joy of motherhood is truly
special--not that fatherhood is any less special.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2445]
Good morning.
I can feel the baby moving around now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2446]
Given how rowdy the little one is being even before birth,
maybe that means we can expect a boy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2447]
I'm scheduled to give birth tomorrow.
Will you stay with me and hold my hand?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2448]
I expect no complications, particularly because Doctor
will be there to see me through labor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2449]
Yu is running around telling everyone that he's a big
brother now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2450]
Grandma is thrilled about <childname>'s
arrival too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2451]
Babies are just so cheek-pinchingly cute.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2452]
Yu comes to visit on occasion. He's so tentative, though.
All he does is peek in and then leave in a hurry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2453]
<childname>'s grabbing onto things and standing
a little bit now. Will they start walking soon, I wonder?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2454]
Such a hefty baby. They've grown so much that I can't
carry them as easily as I used to.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2455]
<childname> reminds me of Yu when he was young.<wait><page>
Always winding up face-down in the dirt, tears streaming
down his face...<wait><page>
I would lose my patience and tell him to stop crying over
every little thing, but maybe I was too hard on him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2456]
Once <childname> gets bigger,
I hope they make lots of friends.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2457]
<childname> wants to talk with you,
<nickname>. ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2458]
A sobering thought: once our baby starts talking more,
I don't know WHAT I'll do if they end up being cheeky
like Yu.<wait><page>
If that happens, I think it would stand as proof that
I don't know how to raise a child properly. *sigh*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2459]
I'm sorry. I'm tired and don't want to talk right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2460]
...Hmph.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2461]
Good morning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2462]
Don't you have work to do?
We have things to discuss afterwards.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2463]
Hmmm...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2464]
Do you want to eat at the Inn today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2465]
Do your best out there today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2466]
Well, I suppose I should get cooking.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2467]
Hurry and finish working so we can spend the evening
together, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2468]
Good morning. How are you feeling?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2469]
Don't overwork yourself. If you end up in the Clinic and
waste a whole day, you'll regret not taking it easier.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2470]
Did you wash your hands?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2471]
I'm so sorry.
It's just one failure after another.
Don't subject yourself to my cooking.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2472]
Morning, <nickname>. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2473]
Good luck at work today. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2474]
Are you taking a break?
You mustn't overwork yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2475]
What in the world is the matter?
You're acting strange, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2476]
You don't need to fret so. The baby is fine.
And Doctor is always there for us.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2477]
Settle down, <nickname>, and go do your work. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2478]
Oh, <nickname>.
Is <childname> doing all right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2479]
We have to work hard for <childname>'s sake
as well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2480]
You're getting in my way, so if you're not sick,
please leave.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2481]
You DO know you're in a Clinic, right? This is a place of
rest and healing. Please quiet down.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2482]
*sigh*
What is it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2483]
I'll return home on schedule, so please head back
without me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2484]
Oh? What about your farm work?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2485]
If you feel ill at all, please see Doctor without delay.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2486]
What's the matter, <nickname>?
Huh? You say have a stomachache because of my cooking?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2487]
Ugh, you're such a prankster.
Do you know what I do to pranksters?
...I use the extra-large needle.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2488]
Are you unwell, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2489]
There's nothing to worry about, you say?<wait><page>
Well, that's a relief.
I was worried that you might be sick.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2490]
Oh, <playername>.
Is something amiss?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2491]
If you feel unwell, you should have Doctor examine you.
Don't be shy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2492]
Oh, so you came to buy medicine today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2493]
If I'm going to get married,
it has to be to someone I respect.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2494]
Everyone says I lose my cool when I'm around Doctor.<wait><page>
I don't have a very wifely demeanor--whatever that
means--if the local gossip is to be believed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2495]
My motherly instincts are kicking in.
I think raising Yu has gotten me used to the idea of
having children.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2496]
Doctor keeps asking how long I plan to keep working at
the clinic.<wait><page>
As long as I can, honestly. So long as a certain physician
doesn't nag me to death first...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2497]
Hm? What's the matter today?
Do you need to speak with Doctor?
Oh, does something not feel right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2498]
I've noticed recently that Doctor resembles my dad a
little. Strange, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2499]
Are you all right?
Did you catch a cold?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2500]
Nothing has changed at work.
He sees the patients, and I assist.
It's that simple.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2501]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
Did you come to see Doctor?
You're such a cute couple.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2502]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
Did you come to see Doctor?
You're such a cute couple.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2503]
It must be so nice.
Me? I don't have time for romance. Work and other
obligations keep me busy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2504]
Curiosity compels me to ask... Does Doctor still act the
same even when he's at home, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2505]
Curiosity compels me to ask... Does Doctor still act the
same even when he's at home, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2506]
You know his lab coat?
I've always been curious if he wears that at home, too.
No, really!<wait><page>
I've never seen him in casual clothes, so I admit my
imagination had started to run away with me...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2507]
Oh, what brings you here, <playername>? Did you pull
a muscle doing all that heavy labor? I imagine it's intense.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2508]
Oh, what brings you here, <playername>? Did you pull
a muscle doing all that heavy labor? I imagine it's intense.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2509]
Luckily for you, you have Doctor at home, so you'll be fine
if anything ever goes awry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2510]
Hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2511]
Hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2512]
How are you feeling?
If there's ever something wrong, no matter how small,
come see Doctor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2513]
You seem so happy, <playername>.
Look, you've even got me smiling.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2514]
You seem so happy, <playername>.
Look, you've even got me smiling.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2515]
How is your spouse?
If they ever get sick, send them right over.
We'll take good care of them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2516]
Say hello to your spouse for me,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2517]
Hello, <playername>.
How are things on the farm?
Are you working hard?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2518]
Are you treating your spouse with the love and respect
they deserve, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2519]
When you live with someone, you can rest easy knowing
that they're only a shout away if something should
happen.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2520]
You mustn't fight with your spouse.
Hm? Well, I suppose there ARE quarrels born out of
intimacy and affection...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2521]
Grandma was so pleased to hear about our marriage.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2522]
Yu was happy, too. He kept saying how excited he was to
get a "real older brother." Little does he know...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2523]
What's the matter today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2524]
If you want to buy medicine, please talk to me.
If you want an examination, please go to Doctor.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2525]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
Are you feeling well today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2526]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
Are you feeling well today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2527]
Farm work must be so taxing.
I imagine it requires a lot of stamina.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2528]
My family--Grandma included--has helped women give
birth for generations. I'm proud of our legacy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2529]
It seems there's a cold going around, so please be sure to
take the necessary precautions.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2530]
You know my grandma, right? I'm studying here because
I want to discover a cure for her leg deterioration.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2531]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
Something tells me you've gotten used to life on the farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2532]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
Something tells me you've gotten used to life on the farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2533]
What originally brought you to this town,
<playername>? It occurs to me that I never even
asked you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2534]
What originally brought you to this town,
<playername>? It occurs to me that I never even
asked you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2535]
Oh, it's you, <playername>!
What is it?
Does something hurt somewhere?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2536]
Oh, it's you, <playername>!
What is it?
Does something hurt somewhere?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2537]
I worry about you being all alone, <playername>, and
not having anyone around if you were to get hurt or sick.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2538]
I worry about you being all alone, <playername>, and
not having anyone around if you were to get hurt or sick.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2539]
I wonder if I'd have to quit working at the Clinic if I got
married.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2540]
I'm not confident that I could handle both work AND all
the obligations that come with being married.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2541]
Good morning, <playername>.
The Clinic is closed today, so I'm spending the day at
home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2542]
Doctor is wandering around somewhere.
He sometimes hikes up the mountain to look for medicinal
plants.<wait><page>
But on days when the sun won't come out, he gets
together with Carter instead.<wait><page>
I wonder what men talk about when they're alone...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2543]
Good morning, <playername>.
If you're looking for Doctor, I think he's in his room.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2544]
Oh, but...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2545]
If it's not an emergency,
could you wait until the Clinic opens?<wait><page>
I like to let him rest in the mornings.
He's always behind on his sleep.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2546]
I'm going shopping today. I need both groceries for home
and some necessities for the Clinic.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2547]
I haven't had a day off in a while.
I forgot how nice it is to relax.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2548]
I do admit it's a little lonely not having Doctor by my side,
though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2549]
Every tomorrow is an opportunity to be better than
today. 
See you then, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2550]
This room was originally Doctor's.<wait><page>
That's why it still has so many educational books to read.
I like to study them after work when I have time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2551]
The books in the other room, though... My poor brain shuts
down when I see words with more than five syllables.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2552]
Oh, hello, <playername>!
The Clinic is closed today.<wait><page>
Are you feeling all right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2553]
Oh, hello, <playername>!
The Clinic is closed today.<wait><page>
Are you feeling all right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2554]
On my days off, I spend time with my grandma. You're
welcome to join us for tea sometime, if you'd like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2555]
Oh, good morning, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2556]
Oh, good morning, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2557]
You're very energetic, given the early hour.
I'm still half-asleep myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2558]
Good evening, <playername>.
I'm always grateful for days when I can see both
Grandma and Yu.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2559]
Good evening, <playername>.
I'm always grateful for days when I can see both
Grandma and Yu.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2560]
Tomorrow, it's back to the daily grind at the Clinic.
Not that I don't value the learning experience.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2561]
Good evening, <playername>.
You must be tired after all your work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2562]
Good evening, <playername>.
You must be tired after all your work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2563]
What brings you here at this hour?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2564]
Doctor's always chiding me and telling me to relax at
home when the Clinic is closed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2565]
Where is HE, you ask? In the Library or at the Church, I
believe.
He tends to like quiet places.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2566]
Hello. The Clinic is closed on Wednesdays. Incidentally,
we don't see each other much outside of there, do we?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2567]
I'd really appreciate it if you'd spend some time with
Grandma. She's homebound and can get rather bored,
you see.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2568]
Today is my weekly shopping day.
Also, Doctor's tab needs paying,
so I'm taking care of that for him.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2569]
Sasha from the General Store is so nice. She often
comes to check on my grandma on her days off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2570]
Tomorrow's the Mochi Bonanza, but do be careful you
don't overeat or choke on your mochi.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2571]
Will you be entering a cow from your farm for this
year's Moo-Moo Festival, too? I'd love to see it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2572]
It's finally the Moo-Moo Festival tomorrow, isn't it?
There are quite a few different types of cows...
I wonder what kinds we'll get to see there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2573]
Our yearly Concert is coming up soon, if you haven't
heard. I've got quite a lot of rehearsals ahead of me...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2574]
The Concert's tomorrow... Wh-What? N-No, of course I'm
not nervous!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2575]
The Fireworks Festival is almost here. Fireworks and
summer go hand-in-hand, wouldn't you say?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2576]
They say it takes a village to make a good Harvest
Festival meal. I wonder what our village will cook up
this year?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2577]
I'd like to bring an ingredient I haven't before to
tomorrow's Harvest Festival...I'm just not quite
sure what.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2578]
I hope the weather stays nice for tomorrow's
Moonlight Night...<wait><page>
You'll be going, too, won't you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2579]
The Autumn Derby is in a few days! I love watching the
horses and all the hard work they do. They're such
wonderful animals.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2580]
Hmm... I suppose it wouldn't hurt to buy tickets for the
Derby.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2581]
You're not from around here, huh?
Whoa, you moved onto that big ol' farm?<wait><page>
Me? I'm Yu. Nice to meetcha, lady.<wait><page>
Ooh, hey, since you've got a farm, that means you've got
cows and stuff, right? Lemme come and pet one
sometime, 'kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2582]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[2583]
Birthdays only come once a year, so I was hopin' for
a super awesome toy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2584]
But I guess I shouldn't be picky. That's what Elly's
always tellin' me, at least. Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2585]
But I guess I shouldn't be picky. That's what Elly's
always tellin' me, at least. Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2586]
Yaaay! Sooo cool! Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2587]
Nice! Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2588]
Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2589]
I'll, uh...give this to Grandma.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2590]
The heck? Yeah, no thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2591]
Whoa! Maximum cuteness!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2592]
Heh heh heh. Can I have that?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2593]
Heh heh heh. Can I have that?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2594]
Thanks. When I grow up, I'll give it to a girl I like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2595]
Thanks. But I'm not gonna use this, so I'll give it to Elly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2596]
Gross! That stinks! What IS it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2597]
Yaaay! Thanks! I love Valentine's 'cuz it means I get to
chow down on chocolate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2598]
Wow, that's super pretty. Oh yeah, I think we've got one
like that at home, too.<wait><page>
Elly said it belonged to Mom, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2599]
Apparently, there's this huuuge lizard in a place called
Forgotten Valley.<wait><page>
I guess it got injured or somethin', and then someone nice
helped it get better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2600]
Hiya, Ms. McFarmsalot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2601]
Hiya, Mr. McFarmsalot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2602]
You sure have a lotta free time.
Just like me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2603]
You sure have a lotta free time.
Just like me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2604]
Heyyy, it's Ms. McFarmsalot!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2605]
Heyyy, it's Mr. McFarmsalot!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2606]
Have you ever ridden a cow?
I wanna try riding one juuust once.<wait><page>
I guess that sounds like a rodeo, huh? Even though those
have bulls instead of cows 'n all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2607]
Oh, hey, Ms. McFarmsalot.
Wouldja play with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2608]
Oh, hey, Mr. McFarmsalot.
Wouldja play with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2609]
Elly's busy at work, and Grandma's legs are messed up,
so I'm kinda lonely.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2610]
Today I'm going to Church. Are you "pie-us" or whatever
they call it?<wait><page>
It's important to "con-fuss," right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2611]
Today I'm going to Church. Are you "pie-us" or whatever
they call it?<wait><page>
It's important to "con-fuss," right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2612]
Carter says that if you say you're REALLY sorry for
doin' somethin' bad, everything'll be forgiven.<wait><page>
I wonder if that means Elly'll forgive me for putting bugs
in her bed?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2613]
Awww, it's all gloomy today.
Wonder if Mei's cooped up at home too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2614]
I wish someone'd take me to Church even when the
weather is all yucky.<wait><page>
Maybe Carter'll come get me if I say "pretty please."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2615]
I don't go to Church on this day.<wait><page>
Elly doesn't work on Wednesdays, and Mei goes out with
her grandpa on Mondays.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2616]
And besides, if I had to play House every day, I'd get
suuuper bored of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2617]
Evenin', Ms. McFarmsalot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2618]
Evenin', Mr. McFarmsalot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2619]
I've gotta go to bed. If kids stay up too late, they'll get
kidnapped by bad people.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2620]
Oh, Ms. McFarmsalot! Hey.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2621]
Oh, Mr. McFarmsalot! Hey.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2622]
Carter makes the BEST snacks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2623]
I'm gonna eat lots and lots of mochi tomorrow!
Just you wait!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2624]
Hey, <playername>! D'you have any cows
in the Moo-Moo Festival?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2625]
Hey, <playername>! D'you have any cows
in the Moo-Moo Festival?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2626]
The cows at the Moo-Moo Festival are suuuper huge,
and there's always so many of them! It's kinda scary,
actually...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2627]
Elly's been practicing for the Concert a whooole bunch.
When I get big, I wanna try singing with everyone, too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2628]
Hey, <playername>? Are you gonna be a part of this
year's Concert, too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2629]
Hey, <playername>? Are you gonna be a part of this
year's Concert, too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2630]
Hm? Who're you?<wait><page>
Huh. So you're the new caretaker of that farm?
I'm Duke. Nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2631]
Oh ho! A birthday present?<wait><page>
Wow, I bet everyone loves you, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2632]
Oh ho! Thank you.<wait><page>
I'm a simple man--I'm happy as long as I have honest work
and a full belly. Thanks for helping me with the latter.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2633]
Oh ho! Thank you. I think I'll hide it from Manna and keep
it all to myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2634]
Thank you. I'll take it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2635]
Hm? What's this? At least tell me it has a good
flavor profile.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2636]
Is this some kind of joke?
You're making fun of me, aren't you?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2637]
Hahaha. Adorable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2638]
Ah... These fellas are always a real pain in the butt.<wait><page>
You're not so fond of wild dogs, right?
Well, it's just like that for me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2639]
Huh? You sure about this?<wait><page>
Huh. Then maybe I'll give it to Adge.
Or Manna, I guess.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2640]
Huh? You sure I can have this?
I'll plan on giving it to Adge, then.
It wouldn't suit Manna, trust me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2641]
Hm? Perfume? Talk about literally putting on
a pretentious air.<wait><page>
Wait, what? It's for me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2642]
Oh ho! Thank you.
I wonder if Manna will give me any.<wait><page>
Not that I particularly care.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2643]
Hahaha, so someone's caught your eye, eh?
Well, good luck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2644]
Hey there, <playername>. If you want to buy
something to drink, the house is thataway.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2645]
Oh, and if you DO end up going there, could you keep
Manna company for a while? Please and thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2646]
I don't really go to the Inn because I particularly crave
their food--I just like talking with the regulars.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2647]
Cliff is rooming at the Inn, you know. He doesn't eat much,
but he has a fairly sophisticated palate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2648]
Hey, <playername>. Always nice to go out with the
family on a day off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2649]
Hey, <playername>. You working hard?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2650]
On days like today, when that afternoon sun is high in the
sky, my mind always seems to wander until I'm darn near
slack-jawed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2651]
Hey, <playername>.
...What? There something on my face?<wait><page>
I didn't drink at all today, for the record.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2652]
Hey, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2653]
What are you doing here this late at night? We only sell
things during the day, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2654]
Manna and I live by ourselves in this house, so we'd
welcome some company every now and then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2655]
Hey, <playername>. How's the farm?
Crops flourishing, animals happy, all that jazz?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2656]
Cliff's been a great help to us. And he seems happier now
that he's married to you.<wait><page>
Having someone you truly care about really does make all
the difference in your quality of life.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2657]
Cliff's been a great help to us. And he seems happier now
that he's married to you.<wait><page>
Having someone you truly care about really does make all

<------------------------------------------------------->
[2658]
Hey, <playername>. How's Cliff?
What's he like at home? Do tell.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2659]
Apparently, Manna's worked herself into a total frenzy
worrying about him.<wait><page>
I, for one, can't be bothered to sweat that kinda stuff.
...So, uh, how's he doing, though?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2660]
Hey. If you're buying something, Manna's your go-to gal.
...You know, my wife?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2661]
Manna loves the sound of her own voice, so it might be
hard to actually, y'know, BUY something from her.<wait><page>
But the reality is that she's just lonely, so I hope you'll
forgive her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2662]
Hey. How are things?
Have you gotten used to your work?<wait><page>
Well, pour yourself a drink of your preferred libation
and take it easy, eh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2663]
The human brain is simple, you know.<wait><page>
Simple to trick, at least. If you convince yourself that
something is good for you, you won't get sick from it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2664]
We're eating out as a family today!
We stopped doing this after Adge left.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2665]
We're going to Church with Cliff today.
I'd never so much as set foot in there until recently.<wait><page>
Turns out it's not so bad to have somewhere quiet and
empty to clear your head every once in a while.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2666]
Hey. Did you come for a bite too, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2667]
Manna? I have no idea what she's doing right now.<wait><page>
Apparently, she'd rather gossip with the neighbors than
cook for me. Figures.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2668]
You look like you're really busting your butt out there.
Cliff is too, y'know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2669]
Dudley's always going on about what a great guy Cliff is.<wait><page>
Contrary to what you might expect, he's actually
a pretty popular guy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2670]
Good to see ya, <playername>!
Are you done working?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2671]
I work myself to the bone every day too, you know.
I've earned myself at least a small drink,
wouldn't you say?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2672]
Now that Cliff's pitching in, my work is a lot easier than
it used to be.<wait><page>
I'm truly grateful to you for connecting us,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2673]
Cliff's made no secret of the fact that he's thankful too.<wait><page>
He was saying he probably wouldn't be here if he hadn't
found this job.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2674]
Hey there, <playername>. What are you doing down
here in the Cellar? We sell drinks at the house, not here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2675]
Nice and cool down here, eh? And this is the only place
you can hear the wine talk. It's alive, just like you or me.<wait><page>
As long as I'm working here, I don't think I'll ever want
to retire.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2676]
Once <childname> gets bigger, you're welcome to
come by for a tour.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2677]
We may not be related by blood, but I think of
<childname> as my own grandchild.<wait><page>
Manna feels the same way, of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2678]
Oh, you're here too, <playername>?
This place is pretty much the definition of "serene."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2679]
I always thought Church was a strict, suffocating place,
but it turns out that's not true in the slightest.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2680]
Hey, <playername>. Y'know, as it turns out, Carter is
a surprisingly decent guy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2681]
Ever since Cliff came into our lives, I've changed my mind
about a lot of things.<wait><page>
Before, I'd just spend Saturdays in a semi-lucid haze.
Now, well...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2682]
Wine comes down to the quality of the fruit used to
make it. Period.<wait><page>
The fruit I painstakingly raise always makes
top-quality wine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2683]
This Winery is named after my daughter.<wait><page>
"Adge Winery," I call it. What do you think? A perfect
name, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2684]
Hope you've gotten used to how much of a chatterbox
Manna is... Well, have you?<wait><page>
If you can tune out the petty stuff, listening to her should
give you a solid sense of the town dynamics.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2685]
Hey, <playername>. Fancy having a glass of my
favorite libation with me sometime?<wait><page>
You know, now that I get a better look at you, you remind
me of my daughter.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2686]
Hey, <playername>. Fancy having a glass of my
favorite libation with me sometime?<wait><page>
You know, now that I get a better look at you, you remind
me of myself in my youth.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2687]
The Mochi Bonanza's tomorrow, huh? Count me in.
I'll be eating my fill for sure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2688]
What's that? You wanna know the odds for the
Derby horses?<wait><page>
You and me both, friend. You and me both...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2689]
I always get real worked up come Derby time.
I look forward to 'em every year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2690]
Will we be seeing any chickens of yours in this year's
Cluck-Cluck Clash, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2691]
The Cluck-Cluck Clash is tomorrow... It's a real lively
little festival, so it's definitely a favorite of mine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2692]
What's that? You wanna know the odds for the
Derby horses?<wait><page>
You and me both, friend. You and me both...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2693]
I always get real worked up come Derby time.
I look forward to 'em every year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2694]
Another year gone, eh? I'll drink to that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2695]
My, my, my! I haven't seen you around before.
Could you be...<playername>?
Bingo! I just KNEW it!
I heard from Thomas that someone new was moving to
town, and he may or may not let your name slip, too.
Hm? Me? Oh, where ARE my manners?
My name is Manna.
My husband Duke and I run this Vineyard. It's ever
so nice to meet you. We may be out in the boonies,
but the folks here are kind, so let us know if you're
ever in a bind. Ooh, I'm a poet! Oh, whoops.
Am I talking too much? I'm so sorry. Bad habit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2696]
Goodness gracious, great balls of cowpat! Is that for me?!
Oh, you're such a sweetheart!
Unlike a certain husband of mine...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2697]
I can tell you right now exactly how this is all going
to shake down. Duke's completely forgotten it's my
birthday today and will come home after stuffing
his face at the Inn. Waking up in a bloated haze,
he'll forget how he got home and what he was doing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2698]
Then he'll finally be like, "Oh no! Yesterday was Manna's
birthday!"<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2699]
He'll rush to the General Store, and even if
it's Tuesday--you know, when they're usually
closed--he'll beg Jeff:<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2700]
"Give me anything here that would work
as a present, stat!"<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2701]
"On the double! I need it by YESTERDAY, pal!
Chop chop!"<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2702]
Or some such thing. And then he'll take that present,
saunter up to me like he's had it all along...
...and hand it over with a dopey smile on his face,
as if nothing had ever happened.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2703]
What will I do with it, you ask?
Return it immediately, of course.
For a full refund.
Duke will have no clue what he even bought me,
so he won't notice if I don't have it anymore.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2704]
Why, thank you! Do you always give such lovely gifts
to the townspeople? If you're going to give gifts,
you should give them out to everyone, you know.
Bad rumors will start circulating if you're only generous
with folks who are young, single, and ready to mingle.
Well, to be honest, everyone likes you enough that you
prooobably don't have to worry. But anyway, thank you.
I love it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2705]
Why, thank you.
You're surprisingly conscientious.
No, that wasn't a backhanded compliment.
It's a good thing! Truly! I live with a pushy,
insensitive oaf of a man like Duke, so...
When I encounter folks like you, I can't help but
compare them to my only frame of reference.
Anyway, thank you so much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2706]
Thank you. Hmmm, yes... Are you making sure to tailor
your gifts to each of your neighbors' preferences?
You can't just give ANY old thing as a gift. That's why
you need to experiment and gauge the recipients'
reactions. They'll be too shy to answer truthfully
if you ask outright, but they're all honest people,
so watch their faces...and that should make their
true feelings clear. Take me right now, for instance.
This gift? It's...okay.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2707]
My, my, my, now THIS is a problem.
I don't like this at all.
Of course, I'm not about to look a gift horse--or
whatever this is--in the mouth since it came from
you, but... I would really prefer to receive something
that doesn't offend at least three of my senses,
you know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2708]
My, my, my. Care to explain what THIS is? I'll pull up
a chair, so go ahead and prepare your explanation.
I'm waiting.
Now, I'm not about to REFUSE it, since it's coming from
you, but other folks would no doubt be furious over
this. Maybe you don't know this, but folks around
here are fairly strait-laced, so be careful with pranks
like this, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2709]
Ahahaha! So, not only are you kind, but you're also
pure as the driven snow, I see.
Yes, yes, you're obviously taking a page out of Yu's book.
But he's usually trying to scare me, not impress me.
Even so, there aren't many small kids in this town,
so I give them more leeway to fool around because
it's cute.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2710]
Wow, that's a hard no from me, thanks! Did you
purposefully choose to show me something I hate, or...?
Ah, yes, of course. You couldn't have avoided this because
you had no way of knowing. Well, now you do.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2711]
Whaaat?! This is for me?
No no no, seriously! It's truly for me?
Where did you--? Ohhh, I see!
You had Saibara make it for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2712]
Guess he has more tricks up his sleeves than I thought.
Then maybe I'll also ask him to-- What's that? I need to
acquire a precious stone MYSELF to give to him?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2713]
Don't you think he charges a liiittle much if all
he's doing is putting the thing together?
Goodness, it's downright disgusting how arrogant
some people can be about their own abilities.
His son has been begging Saibara to move in with him,
but he absolutely refuses to leave this town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2714]
But all's well that ends well, I suppose. At least his
grandson is living with him now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2715]
Oh, my! Now THAT'S something right up my alley! Hm?
You're giving it to me?
Yesss! I'm tickled pink. Thank you.
I never DREAMED someone would give me such
a wonderful gift.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2716]
Oh, my! Is that for me?
You're an odd duck, aren't you?
I work at a Vineyard, so I use my nose to distinguish
the scent of good grapes. Thus, I only use perfume
when I go out. But I DO love this fragrance.
If you were a suave, rugged bachelor,
my heart points would have maxed out just now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2717]
Oh, my! Is that for me?
You're an odd duck, aren't you?
I work at a Vineyard, so I use my nose to distinguish
the scent of good grapes.
Thus, I only use perfume when I go out.
But I DO love this fragrance.
Mm-mm-mmm! To die for. ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2718]
Oh, do you cook much, by any chance?
I'll teach you how to make Mashed Potatoes.
Are you ready? You'll need to memorize this.
If you want to fetch something to write the recipe
down on, that would be best. Go ahead, I'll wait.
...Hm? Do *I* have something? Oh, no, no.
I love to talk, so I'll just tell you, all right?
The main ingredients are Potatoes, Butter, and Milk.
You'll also need a Pot, a Rolling Pin, and an Oven!
Oh, and Seasonings, too. Heat the Potatoes in the Oven,
crush them, and then mix them with the Butter and Milk.
Are you sure you can remember all this without writing
it down? ...No, I'm not making fun of you.
Perish the thought! It's just that I said it so fast,
I even surprised myself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2719]
Oh, NO you didn't! Mm-mm!
...Aha. I see what's going on here.
So, tell me. Who's the lucky so-and-so?
Someone in this town, I assume? Right?
Goodness, I simply CANNOT believe I hadn't caught wind
of this sooner. Well, I suppose since you never breathed
a word of it to me, I had absolutely no way of knowing.
Speaking of which, are you trying for some kind
of...cool cucumber vibe? You never actually SAY anything.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2720]
Listen to this, <playername>.
Our daughter has started contacting us once
a week, all on her own. Until now, it was always us
trying to force some sort of communication out of her.
This is all thanks to Sasha having a word with her,
I'm sure. Oh, it is SO good to have friends in your
corner.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2721]
Oh, my! Hello, hello, hello. ♪
How is <childname> doing, hmm?
You seem to be gone quite a lot.
Do you think children just sort of raise themselves
without supervision? I suppose that's one approach
you could take to parenting.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2722]
After all, even if the parents DO stick around, the child
could one day up and skip town, like ours did.
Children do whatever they please without a second
thought as to how it affects their parents, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2723]
You'll be fine, <playername>.
With Cliff as your husband, <childname> is bound
to be happy. I hope you'll keep taking good care
of Cliff--and <childname> too, of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2724]
I haven't given up on Adge, either.
I'm sure she'll come back home someday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2725]
My, what a coincidence!
Fancy running into you here.
How's Cliff?
What's he like at home, I wonder?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2726]
He's always been so overly considerate towards us that
he ends up hiding how he really feels.
Duke and I were just talking about that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2727]
I'm sure he's comfortable enough to let his hair
down around you--not that he has a ton.
Do you ever get into fights? It's best NOT to fight,
of course, but there's something a little eerie about
couples who NEVER squabble, you know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2728]
Oh dear, there I go again, off on another rant.
Me and my big mouth!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2729]
Oh, <playername>. Hello there. How's the farm?
Is it-- Are you-- Er. Slow down, Manna.
One thought at a time.
You know, to be honest, I'm actually heading to the
Plaza right now, so I don't have time to chat. Sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2730]
I decided to quit going to the Plaza to gossip on
Saturdays. I know, who am I and what have I done
with Manna? But it's much more fun chatting with
Duke and Cliff at the Inn!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2731]
Oh, dear. I wonder if this'll keep up all day long. It's like
I've got my own personal raincloud following me!
I mean, I'm not making a groundbreaking statement here,
but I can't be cooped up in the house all day.
I'd go stir-crazy. No matter who I talk with on
days like this, everyone spaces out. We have
a dire shortage of good listeners.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2732]
Apparently, Cliff likes going to hear Carter proselytize
at Church. Why in the world do you think that is?
Personally, I can't understand a word that comes
out of Carter's mouth.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2733]
He's apparently got a way of really captivating an
audience, but I'm not so sure...
In any case, Church doesn't exactly encourage ME to talk
much, so I want to get it all out here while I still can.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2734]
I'm going to Anna's house right now. Sasha is always
rushing me out the door, and Lillia has no patience for me,
you know. Anna, on the other hand, always seems to look
forward to my visits. There isn't anyone else like her in
this town, so she's one of my favorite people to chat with.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2735]
Oh, is it that late already?
Doesn't it feel like the days fly by?
I swear, I blink and suddenly there's no time left for me
to have a leisurely chat with Duke.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2736]
Oh, my. You're up early, <playername>.
I suppose you can't very well sleep in when you work
on a farm. Hmmm? You sometimes do anyway?!
Heavens to homesteading, <playername>... No, no.
I suppose that might be for the best in the end.
After all, being TOO eager can backfire on you every
so often. Trust me. I know from experience.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2737]
Oh, <playername>. You're still here?
Well, as long as we're on the subject, you know who
ELSE is an eager beaver? Ellen's granddaughter, Elly. 
She's an angel, but...how should I put this? She works too
hard for someone her age, on top of trying to raise Yu.
I feel so sorry for her!
I notice Yu crying by himself a lot, too.
They both have it so hard, poor things.
Don't you think that's sad, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2738]
Oh, my! Thanks.
I know I don't talk to you much, <playername>,
so it might be weird bringing this up, but...
My daughter left me and this town behind, you know.
Poof, just like that. And to top it all off, Duke--
Duke's my husband, in case you didn't know. Anyway, he
goes out drinking every night, leaving me all alone.<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2739]
To be honest, I've been lonely. That's why I try to talk
to people as much as I can, just to take my mind off it.
But the pain of not having your child around...
It really can't be expressed in words. If she'd gone
off to be someone's bride, that would be one thing, but...
Oh, speaking of which, you came here on your own too,
right, <playername>? Why'd you do that, anyway?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2740]
Oh, <playername>!
Question: do you talk to Kai a lot?
When he first came to this town, he was just a teenager,
you know. He had Gotts--that's the old carpenter who
lives on the mountain, just so you know--build him
a small house. And up it went, smack dab in the middle
of Mineral Beach.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2741]
And then, the very next day--get this--Kai painted
the house this tacky white color! We all thought he
was SO odd. There was a big stir when Carter came
to town too, but Kai's way of talking really got under the
other men's skin. If I said so much as a single kind word
about Kai, I'd never hear the end of it from Duke!
I tell you, men take pride in the most meaningless things...
Who cares how someone talks?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2742]
Oh, <playername>. How's the farm?
Speaking of farms, the youngest over at Yodel Ranch left
quite a while back, just like our daughter did.
Mind you, Mugi is a lot older than us, and all alone, too.
And to top it all off, after ten whole years, Joanna
finally-- Oh, that's Mugi's daughter, for the record.
Anyway, Joanna finally came back, but with a little girl in
tow! If I were Mugi, I'd have been flabbergasted!
What's more, immediately after that, Joanna uproots
herself once again and leaves Mineral Town in the dust.
Here's the kicker to the whole story: that little girl
Joanna brought? Our very own Mei. I feel so sorry
for her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2743]
Mugi has it hard too, you know.
To this very day, he hasn't seen hide nor hair of Joanna.<wait><page>
Mugi says that even if Joanna comes back for Mei, he'll
refuse to let her take Mei away. Good for him, I say.<wait><page>
I may not have any business chiming in as an outsider, but
my heart just breaks for poor Mugi and Mei!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2744]
Oh, <playername>. How's the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2745]
By the by, you don't know anything about Rod,
do you, <playername>? He's Lillia's husband,
and the one who came to Mineral Town with that
shipper, Zack. They met on the road, and when Rod
heard that Zack had no relatives and no job, he offered
him free room and board. After a while, Zack found work
as a shipper, and the rest is history. You know, before
Zack arrived, a boat would only come to town once
a month. He's been a real asset to the community.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2746]
But Lillia is so nice to Zack that he seems to have fallen
head over heels for her. Except she's the wife of the guy
who saved him. He won't give up, but he can't make
a move, either. It's really quite sad. And Lillia, bless her
heart, is so flaky that she doesn't have the first clue how
Zack feels. Me? No, no, I could never tell her. I try not to
rock the boat as much as possible, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2747]
Oh, <playername>. Hello there.
I'm chatting with Anna right now.
Apparently, the place where Anna lived before coming
here almost brushes shoulders with where my daughter
is now. Doesn't that just make you so curious?
I wonder what kind of life she's living.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2748]
Anna makes such decadent desserts!
I always look forward to visiting her on Saturdays.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2749]
Oh, oh, listen to this!
Today I just happened to overhear that...did... And THEN...
So SHE said... Can you believe it?!
Doesn't that just boggle your mind?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2750]
...Mm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2751]
Yes! You said it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2752]
Oh, perish the thought! No, no, no. They're obviously...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2753]
Why, you ask?
Well, let me tell you...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2754]
Yes, exactly. I mean, I've never heard of such a thing, and...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2755]
Oh, <playername>. Hello there.
What's new? Hear any interesting rumors?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2756]
Listen to this! Duke racked up ANOTHER tab at the
General Store! And for 5,000G, no less!
What in the world did he buy that he kept completely
secret from me?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2757]
And what sort of racket is Jeff running in the first
place? I'M the one who pays here. I wonder if
it can even be returned? And you know what
I heard from Dudley the other day?
That Duke calls Adge basically every day.
If he's going to spend that much on long-distance
phone calls, he may as well go to see her.
I mean, good grief.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2758]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
Is <childname> sleeping?
Once <childname> gets bigger, we can all have
a meal together here. Wouldn't that be nice?
Come to think of it, don't you think Cliff looks much
happier now? Well, he IS a father now, after all.
I suppose it's only natural he'd light up.
Duke used to look exactly like that back when Adge
was first born.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2759]
Now that <childname> is here, I suppose that
makes me a grandma.
It's such a strange feeling.
Huh? You're surprised I feel that way?
Regardless of ancestry, I think of you and
<childname> as family.
Don't you forget that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2760]
Oh, hello, <playername>.
Are you working right now?
You're welcome to join us, if you like.
I understand that you're busy, but it won't kill you to
spend some time with your family every now and then.
I won't force you, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2761]
I think of you as my daughter, <playername>.
I have another daughter too, of course, which makes you
her sister! If she ever comes back, I hope you two get
along.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2762]
I think of you as my son, <playername>.
I have a daughter too, of course, which makes you her
brother! If she ever comes back, I hope you two get along.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2763]
Hello there, <playername>.
Now that Cliff is with us, we've started coming to the
Inn on Saturdays to have weekly meals together.
After we finish eating, we always go to the Church.
Aren't we the spitting image of a real family? Hahaha.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2764]
Duke has been so much happier since Cliff arrived.
The same goes for me, of course, but...
Days like this remind me of when Adge was around.
Eating out with the family... Aah, it takes me back.
Cliff is such a good guy that I can't help but fuss over
him, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2765]
Oh, you're here too, <playername>?
What about <childname>?
Establishing healthy habits should be a priority, both for
you and your family. Kids deserve the chance to be kids.
You should bring <childname> here sometime.
Carter said he wants to see mini-Cliff too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2766]
Ever since <childname> was born, Duke and
I haven't been fighting as much. It's like his prickly
exterior has all but melted away. I suppose you
aren't at that point in your relationship yet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2767]
Cliff certainly is fond of Carter.
Because Carter supported him the most when he first
arrived in town, Cliff goes to Church every week
without fail. I've heard him speak a number of times
now, and he's a pretty fascinating man.
Have you heard his sermons, <playername>?
Churches are only as good as their priests,
and we lucked out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2768]
If a person puts their mind to it, they can become
whoever and whatever their heart desires.
So much has changed since I met Cliff.
My worldview, my lifestyle...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2769]
Cliff is such a serious guy. I've decided not to pry into
his past and let him speak for himself instead.
It broke my heart when I heard from Carter how
terribly hurt Cliff was and how often he came to Church.
I want to try and be a surrogate mother to him.
It's the least I can do. Duke told me that if Cliff says he
likes the Vineyard, then he's thinking about taking him in.
I'm sure Duke still loves our daughter more than
anything, but... I also feel like life can't continue the
way it has been. We've stagnated. And I've had enough.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2770]
You have to be quiet in Church, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2771]
Do you know that girl named Jennifer? She lives at the
Inn, but she's a bit of an oddball, let me tell you.
Apparently, she used to be an aristocrat or something,
but she got tired of having her life dictated and ran
away. To be honest--and this is just me--I would've been
perfectly happy living a life of wealth and luxury. Just
saying... This conversation reminds me of my daughter,
actually. I wonder what she's doing right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2772]
Hey, did you know that Brandon is apparently a famous
artist? It turns out that there are good art-making
materials in the mountains around here. That's why
he came to town. The story goes that Gotts found him
collapsed in the mountains. Collapsed! Can you
imagine? One thing led to another, and now he's
freeloading at Gotts' mountain shack. But what kind
of art does he even make? I'd like to see his work
sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2773]
That girl Jennifer says there's a Goddess living in the
mountain by this town. According to her, a bunch of
fairies live here too. Yeah, sure, Jen.
Talk about having a few screws loose.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2774]
Have you seen any of Brandon's art, <playername>?
Word is, he's made quite a name for himself in the
art world. His pieces are very avant-garde, or so
I've heard. Something tells me his work would go
right over my head.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2775]
You know about the Mochi Bonanza, don't you?
Of course you do, the town's abuzz about it. 
I can't help out much with the preparations,
but with the mochi-eating? You know I'll be there!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Every time Derby season rolls around, Duke can't seem
to sit still. We've been together for years, but I still get a
kick out of it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2777]
I enjoy watching the horses as much as everyone else in
this town, though! So I'll be going, too, of course.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2778]
We've had some especially tasty morsels in Cooking
Exhibitions past. I'm sure this year's will be just as
scrumptious!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2779]
"Do I have confidence in my culinary skill?" What kind of
question is that, silly? Of course I do!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2780]
The Harvest Festival's in a few days! I'm still deciding
what kind of ingredients to bring!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2781]
Well, <playername>, I've just GOT to know what
you'll be bringing to the Harvest Festival!
I'm sure you have plenty of produce from your
farm to share with us, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2782]
Oh, goodness, another year gone already?
But I don't WANT to age another year...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2783]
Aha, so you have brought it. Very good. Allow me to show
you my most superlative wares.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2784]
Oh? Your Bag is full, I'm afraid. You'll have to sort that
out before you buy any of my wares.<wait>

...Or so I WOULD say, but it would appear that you
presently cannot afford even my least expensive
commodity.<wait><page>
Piteous indeed. I suppose we'll have to wait until you've
saved up a little more. At least 1,000,000G should do.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2799]
Today's special item is...TA-DAAAH!
"<string0>."
It will cost you <string1>G.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2800]
Aha. A most familiar item indeed.<wait><page>
If you have at least 1,000,000G to spare, I can show you
another of my wares.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2801]
Will you buy this item?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2802]
Yes! Money is no object!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2803]
Not at THAT price!
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2804]
Thank you for your business.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2805]
I see. A pity.<wait><page>
Bear in mind that the next time you drop by,
I may have a different item available for sale.<wait><page>
So please, go ahead and bring me the exact same thing
again then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2806]
Oh ho! And on my birthday, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2807]
Great gilded goddess of gift-giving, this is a most valuable
item indeed! I will cherish it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2808]
A present? For me?
Thank you. I shall keep it close.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2809]
Erm, I'm afraid I'm...not particularly fond of this,
but I appreciate the thought nonetheless. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2810]
What manner of tasteless japery...?!
I've no need of something so worthless!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2811]
Oh, what a precious little thing!
Hahahaha!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2812]
YIKES! I'll kindly ask you to put some distance between
me and THAT, please!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2813]
Oh ho! A quality item indeed, that.
Hm? It is a present for me?<wait><page>
Why, thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2814]
Aah, now THIS is quite the treasure.
Hm? It is a present for me? Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2815]
What a luxurious fragrance!
Why, if opulence had a scent...!<wait><page>
Hm? It is for me? How very kind.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2816]
Aha, that's right. Today is the holiday wherein chocolate
is exchanged.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2817]
A lovely feather, that. I'm sure it would fetch a handsome
price on the market.<wait><page>
Hm? It is a symbolic token exchanged during a marriage
proposal? I see! Congratulations to you, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2818]
Word is that an unassuming little farm in Forgotten
Valley by the name of <linkedfarmname> is highly
profitable.<wait><page>
Personally, I believe the owner must be up to some
manner of shenanigans on the side if they are making
THAT much money.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2819]
I've half a mind to travel to Forgotten Valley before long.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2820]
Forgotten Valley is quite the interesting place.
I may go visit it again soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2821]
I do believe I'll travel to Forgotten Valley again in the
near future.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2822]
Is something the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2823]
I have a wide variety of rare and luxuriant curios
for sale.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2824]
My travels to far-flung locales have supplied me with all
manner of rare regional goods.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2825]
When I happen upon an unusual item, I find myself almost
compelled to buy it on the spot.<wait><page>
I suppose my desire to collect the wonders of this world
must be embedded in my very nature. Hahaha.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2826]
One of the regions I visit most is Forgotten Valley.
It is a peaceful and pleasant place.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2827]
I highly encourage you to visit someday,
<playername>. I'm willing to bet top dollar you'd find
it agreeable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2828]
I have been to many places. I have met many people and
seen many things. But of all the myriad places I have
been...<wait><page>
Mineral Town ranks among my favorites. Such kind
people and lush environs. Forgotten Valley is a close
second.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2829]
You know, I think I'd like to stay here in this town for as
long as I can.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2830]
Hello there! You are <playername>, correct?<wait><page>
My name is Harris. It's my honor to be the constable
of Mineral Town.<wait><page>
Our community is as serene as it is crime-free, so don't
worry. You will be perfectly safe here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2831]
Thank you!<wait><page>
What an honor it is to have the townsfolk I serve
celebrate my birthday like this. I'm a lucky man indeed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2832]
Thank you! And not just for the lovely gift, but for even
thinking of me in the first place.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2833]
Thank you!
I appreciate your thoughtfulness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2834]
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2835]
Erm, w-well... Your heart was certainly in
the right place...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2836]
I admit to feeling disappointed--not out of greediness, but
because I didn't think you capable of being so hurtful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2837]
Hahaha! How cute! Little critters like this one really are
adorable, aren't they?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2838]
Erm, I'm sorry. I, ah...
I admit it! I'm scared of those!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2839]
Wow! That's incredible.
What? It's a present for me?<wait><page>
Thank you. No, really. You're too kind.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2840]
Wow! That's incredible.
And it's a present for me, you say?<wait><page>
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2841]
The young folk around here--Kai, Karen, and the
others--have quite a flair for fashion, don't you think?<wait><page>
No doubt Adge is surrounded by lots of similarly stylish
folks in the city.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2842]
Thank you. It would be so nice if Adge was here to give
me some, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2843]
<playername>, I imagine you must be busy enough
with work that finding time to cook for yourself is
difficult.<wait><page>
Why don't I teach you a simple recipe that you can whip
up quickly? Like, say...Fried Rice? Great! Listen closely.<wait><page>
It's easy. First, you put some Oil in your Frying Pan. Then,
add an Egg and some Onigiri, and cook until they're done.<wait><page>
And there you have it: Fried Rice! See, I told you it was
an easy recipe.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2844]
<playername>, you're getting married?
Congratulations! I'm jealous.
I'd like to do the same someday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2845]
Many years ago, I saw a man named Moy on TV. I hear he
lives somewhere in Forgotten Valley now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2846]
I was greatly impressed by his natural, effortlessly free
lifestyle. I'd like to meet him someday, if I could.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2847]
Phew. Just a little longer and I'll be done with today's
work. As always, I'm glad our town is so peaceful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2848]
You'd best be on your way home soon too,
<playername>. Wild dogs and such come out at night,
after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2849]
Oof, how about this weather, huh? But it'll take more
than that to keep me away from my patrol. <wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2850]
Please tell me you don't plan to climb the mountain today.
It is far, far too dangerous in this weather.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2851]
Hello there, <playername>.
How goes your day?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2852]
Another placid day in Mineral Town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2853]
Hello there. How are you doing? Have you caught wind of
any strange or unusual activity?<wait><page>
Hahaha. No, I'm sure you haven't.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2854]
All right, time to give today my all!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2855]
Good morning.
It's time to face another day head-on!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2856]
Every morning, I wake up excited to see the happy faces
of all the townsfolk. Do you think that makes me odd?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2857]
Hello there, <playername>.
Are you taking a break too?<wait><page>
It's important to close your eyes, breathe deeply, and
center yourself every so often. Stress takes a toll.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2858]
Don't worry. Everyone knows that they can find me here
at this hour.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2859]
When I take my daily patrols, I always stop at Mr. Gotts'
house for a short break.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2860]
On Saturdays, Mr. Gotts comes to visit me at my place
instead.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2861]
Hello there, <playername>. How goes your day?
Everything safe and secure on the farm?<wait><page>
If you see anything suspicious, let me know right away.
I'm always on call, whether early or late, rain or shine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2862]
I patrol Mineral Town like this every day. We're
fortunate that it's such a quiet, safe place to live.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2863]
I wonder what Adge is doing today...<wait><page>
Wah! <playername>! Please don't sneak up on me like
that. You startled me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2864]
Adge is Mr. Duke's--the owner of the Vineyard's--
daughter. She is a truly lovely person.<wait><page>
I hear she is currently living in the big city.
I admit I'm rather preoccupied with the idea.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2865]
Ahh, it's Derby season once again! Our Derbies are really
something special, if you ask me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2866]
We've got lots of great horses racing in this Derby,
I hear. Now it's just a matter of seeing which one
emerges victorious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

[2869]
What do you think about the Fluffy Festival,
<playername>? Are you going to enter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2870]
We call it the Fluffy Festival because alpacas and
Angora rabbits can enter, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2871]
Ah! You're <playername>, yes?
A most auspicious meeting indeed.
Thomas told me all about you.<wait><page>
My name is Carter, and I am the town priest.
I hope I see you at Church.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2872]

<------------------------------------------------------->
[2873]
Oh, is this for me?<wait><page>
Well, look at me turning redder than a bottle full
of holy sacrament. Thank you. I'm delighted.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2874]
Thank you. Labor as I might in the realm of the divine,
I lack a true "job" here, so I feel blessed by such kindness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2875]
Thank you. This is a true blessing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2876]
A boon, to be sure. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2877]
I'll...take it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2878]
My stars and holy garters...
Well, this is awkward. I'm not entirely sure why you
would give this to me.<wait><page>
I will...think it over for a while.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2879]
Ah! Marvelous.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2880]
I spurn such things, actually.
Perhaps it stems from some childhood trauma
I would just as soon forget.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2881]
Thank you very much. Are you sure?<wait><page>
I get the feeling that this is no everyday object.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2882]
Thank you very much.<wait><page>
I'm not sure I'll be able to get any use out of it,
admittedly, but...<wait><page>
I would be rude to refuse your kindness.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2883]
Aha! So that's where that heavenly fragrance was
wafting from. I most gratefully accept.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2884]
I'll teach you how to make a treat that I often fix for the
children.<wait><page>
It's quite a straightforward recipe--no pen or paper
required, I'd reckon. You simply need Strawberries
and Milk.<wait><page>
You put those in a Mixer, blend them together,
and in a blink of an eye, it's done.<wait><page>
Hm? You'd rather just BUY some Strawberry Milk?
But creating it yourself is far more satisfying.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2885]
Oh, what auspicious news!
Shall I pray that all goes well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2886]
Evidently, there's a couple that lives on a farm
in the next town over who inspire envy with
the intensity of their love.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2887]
Not to spread idle gossip, but I heard that a strange
creature lives in the forest at Forgotten Valley.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2888]
The rumor goes on to say that it used to be human long,
long ago. What could have triggered its transformation,
I wonder?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2889]
A part-time job at the Vineyard, hm?
That sounds lovely.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2890]
I appreciate you telling me, but if it wouldn't be too much
trouble, might you alert Cliff to the opportunity instead?<wait><page>
He DID say he was looking for a job, if I'm not mistaken.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2891]
A blessed day to you.
This is the Church.<wait><page>
A priest I may be, but only in title.
I don't really do anything around here.<wait><page>
Why, you ask? Because the meaning of "happiness"
I believe in has become something altogether
unrecognizable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2892]
Yet despite my own circumstances, I will not reject any
who come to me in search of salvation.<wait><page>
The Church also has a Confessional, which is at your
disposal should you ever wish to unburden yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2893]
Do you think that when we create graves, the dead
stay in them forever? I ask, but in truth, none can say.<wait><page>
Still, we cling to our rituals, likely because we fear
forgetting that which has lost physical form.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2894]
Nature Sprites live in the forest beyond the Church.<wait><page>
If you befriend them, they'll help you with your work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2895]
Hello, <playername>.
Good weather is such a blessing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2896]

The kind and gentle spirit of Mineral Town
is immediately apparent when I look at Mei
and Yu's upbringing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2898]
Heavens above, <playername>.
...No, I mean that literally.
Do be mindful of the skies today.<wait>

Given the weather, it doesn't seem as though the children
will be coming by, either.<wait><page>
You should hurry on home yourself.
I wouldn't want you to catch a cold.<wait>

[2902]
Ah, perfect timing. Might you stay long enough to
listen to a parable of mine? I'll warn you--it may
get a little long.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2903]
I'm all ears.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2904]
Sorry, I left my...farm...on.

Ah, bless you.<wait>

[2906]
Once upon a time, in a land not unlike our own, there was
a normal family. The kind one would find anywhere.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2907]
A father, mother, and their juvenile son all lived together
in blissful harmony.<wait><page>
One day, the mother succumbed to a virulent illness
and suddenly passed away.<wait><page>
As the grief-stricken father stood over his late wife,
the little boy came up to him, and asked:<wait><page>
"What happened to Mom?"
The boy curiously peered at his dearly departed mother's
unblinking face.<wait><page>
The father, unsure what to say, desperately explained
that she had fallen into a deep sleep.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2908]
Upon hearing that, the boy was greatly troubled.
He told his father:<wait><page>
"Then please, Dad. Use all of my allowance and buy a big
alarm clock to wake her up."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2909]
What do you think of that?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2910]
That was when the father learned that the diluted
words adults use to avoid speaking of death...<wait><page>
...hold neither power over nor meaning to children.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2911]
Think on that.
I bid you a blessed day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2912]
Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived
a beautiful girl.<wait><page>
Her hair was black as ebony, her skin as white as snow,
and her lips as red as blood.<wait><page>
The girl's mother, a witch, had in her possession
a magical mirror. One day, she asked the mirror:<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2913]
"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them
all?" The mirror replied:<wait><page>
"Of course, it is you, my queen."
The witch smirked in satisfaction.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2914]
If the mirror had said any name but her own, she would
have sent her servants to expunge them from the earth.<wait><page>
And if the servants were to fail in their solemn duty, she
would poison that person with her own two hands.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2915]
In truth, the mirror knew that the ebony-haired girl was
the fairest of them all, but feared the price of honesty.<wait><page>
And so, it lied.
Everyone lived happily ever after.
The end.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2916]
What do you think?
That story is called "Snow-White Lies." Mull that over
until we next meet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2917]
This is a true story that takes place before I became
a priest.<wait><page>
Once, I was penniless and lived out my days in a small
apartment.<wait><page>
From my apartment window, when the curtains were
drawn, I could see into the building right across from
mine.<wait><page>
The room I could see was just as gloomy as mine.
Eventually, I learned that a married couple lived there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2918]
The wife would leave for work each day while the
husband remained behind. I assumed he was some
sort of artist.<wait><page>
At least, that's what I thought at first, until I noticed
something odd.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2919]
Whenever I looked into their living space, he was always
squatting in the exact same position.<wait><page>
From then on, I found myself paying much more attention
to that room across the way.<wait><page>
The husband remained in the exact same place and
posture from when the curtains opened to when they
closed at night.<wait><page>
But he was not motionless. I could see him talking and
moving his head.<wait><page>
Fixated upon this man I had never met, I became
desperate to learn the reason why.<wait><page>
One day, a small fire broke out in that apartment.
My gaze hovered over their open window.<wait><page>
And what did I find but the husband squatting in his usual
place, a troubled expression etched upon his face.<wait><page>
I knew the wife had left for the day, so I scrambled over
to help the husband.<wait><page>
By the time I arrived, the room was filled with smoke,
but I could see him turning toward me.<wait><page>
Running to his side, I laid my hands upon him,
ready to forcibly drag him out...<wait><page>
...but despite his weedy appearance--surely he would
be as light as paper, I told myself--his body was
stone-heavy.<wait><page>
That was when my eyes traveled downward...and saw
four hands jutting from the floor, holding him in place.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2920]
"Aaaaaagh!"<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2921]
Phew... Even now, remembering the horror I felt in that
moment still gives me goosebumps.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2922]
Cliff has left the town.<wait><page>
We are all the masters of our own destinies. He has to
decide for himself to change his circumstances.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2923]
And sometimes people just run out of money.
Unfortunately, that is one problem I cannot help with.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2924]
Cliff has changed since he married you. His spirit is
lighter. I can see it in his face.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2925]
Cliff has changed since he married you. His spirit is
lighter. I can see it in his face.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2926]
In the end, you're the one who saved Cliff.<wait><page>
Since coming here, I've realized what amazing power lies
within the bonds of human connection.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2927]
Cliff has been much happier since he decided to work
at the Vineyard. It's all thanks to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2928]
A young man named Cliff comes to Church every day
saying he wants to atone for his sins.<wait><page>
Do you understand the fundamental truth of atonement,
<playername>?<wait>

What matters most is devoting yourself earnestly to the

When the weather is bad on Wednesdays,
Doctor inevitably shows up at my place, wine in hand.
Bless that man.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2934]
That's why I often find myself wishing for some
precipitation when Wednesday rolls around.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2935]
Doctor and I always make small talk whenever
we eat together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2936]
Well, good evening.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2937]
There's a basement in this Church.
Incidentally, that's where I sleep.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2938]
Well, "sleep" may not be the right word...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2939]
Shall I tell you why I do so little spiritual outreach
in this town?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2940]
Because the townspeople live according to the Goddess'
teachings without even realizing it.<wait><page>
There is nothing for me to teach.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2941]
And yet here I am, living among them.<wait><page>
Which is why I must try to find some other,
higher purpose for my life.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2942]
Everyone says graveyards are eerie, but I beg to differ.<wait><page>
This is a place where people leave their treasured
memories--happy memories of days long past...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2943]
Have you met the Nature Sprites yet?<wait><page>
They don't often reveal themselves.
Only those pure in heart and earnest in spirit
are able to see them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2944]
Is there anything that's been weighing on your mind
recently?<wait><page>
If you wish to unburden yourself, feel free to visit the
Confessional anytime. I pledge to listen without judgment.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2945]
Everyone in this town is so kind.
Even a pseudo-mendicant like me can manage to get by
thanks to them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2946]
The Mochi Bonanza is upon us once again. It's a truly
joyous occasion. I hope we'll see you there, as well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2947]
What kinds of meals will this year's Cooking Exhibition
bring us, I wonder?<wait><page>
I cannot partake, but the thought is certainly
entertaining.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2948]
The Cooking Exhibition takes place tomorrow.
I cannot help but wonder whose cuisine will
reign supreme this year...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2949]
Might you be participating in this year's Moo-Moo
Festival, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2950]
It will be a pleasure to watch tomorrow's Moo-Moo
Festival. The cows there never cease to impress me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2951]
I pray you'll take part in this year's Concert with us.
You would be a wonderful addition to our group.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2952]
I expect a delightful performance at tomorrow's Concert.
Everyone's been practicing so diligently.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2953]
I must be sure to have enough ingredients on hand...
The Harvest Festival draws near, after all!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2954]
Have you thought about what you'd like to add to our
Harvest Festival hodgepodge, <playername>? As a
farmer, I'm sure you have much to choose from.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2955]
Derby season is upon us once again. We are blessed to be
able to watch such majestic horses compete.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2956]
Tomorrow is the Derby, is it not? I wish all the
participants a good race. I shall be cheering them on
with the rest of the town!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2957]
Tomorrow, we'll all be feasting on soba. Let us reflect on
our progress and growth as the year comes to a close.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2958]
Hm? Oh, hey. Haven't seen you around before. You new?
I'm Kai. Nice to meetcha.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2959]
Whoa, you remembered my birthday?
Right on! Thanks!<wait><page>
Don't you worry, <nickname>. I'll make sure to hit
you back twofold on YOUR birthday. Trust and believe.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2960]
Whoa, thanks! I'm surprised you even knew what
SEASON I was born in, let alone the exact day! You rock.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2961]
Ooh, SOMEBODY's been payin' attention! Y'know, this is
one of the things I like best about you.<wait><page>
There's just somethin' special about a present that's had
a lotta thought and care put into it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2962]
Whoa, a pineapple?! Thanks a bunch!
ALL summer fruits deserve love, but pineapples are
primo. Glad you agree.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2963]
Thanks, <nickname>. Nobody knows what I like
quite like you do.<wait>

Whoa, thanks! Good looking out.<wait>

[2971]
Yo! What the heck kinda garbage are you tryin' to give
me?! Sometimes I really don't get you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2972]
Hey, quick question: what's your major malfunction?
I really don't have time for your weird pranks or
whatever.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2973]
Dude, c'mon. Don't you think you're too old for that?
You're a real wild card, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2974]
Dude, c'mon. Don't you think you're too old for that?
You're a real wild card.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2975]
Yo! What the salty, sea-soaked HECK,
<nickname>?! You're kinda bein' the worst
right now. Knock it off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2976]
Yo! What the salty, sea-soaked HECK, dude?! You're
kinda bein' the worst right now. Knock it off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2977]
Sweet! Thanks, <nickname>!
Appreciate it.<wait><page>
Y'know? Come to think of it, I've never seen you wear
anything like this, <nickname>.<wait><page>
Any reason for that, or...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2978]
Hey, thanks! I know it takes all types to make the world

D'you ever wear stuff like this, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2979]
Hey, thanks! I know it takes all types to make the world

D'you ever wear stuff like this, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2980]
Hey, uh, you sure this isn't yours,
<nickname>?<wait><page>
Maybe I could give this to one of the other girls... Haha!
Just kidding. I'll take good care of it. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2981]
Whoa, niiice! Girls tend to like stuff like this, don't they?
Maybe I oughta re-gift this to someone... I kid, I kid!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2982]
Whoa, niiice! Girls tend to like stuff like this, don't they?
Maybe I oughta re-gift this to someone... I kid, I kid!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2983]
Whoa, niiice!<wait><page>
What, you're giving it to me? Thanks! Have YOU ever

<------------------------------------------------------->
[2984]
Whoa, niiice!
Huh? You're giving it to me? Thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2985]
Whoa, thanks! My mouth is waterin'. Wait...hold on a sec.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2986]
What the heck am I doing here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2987]
For Valentine's Day, eh? Thanks.<wait><page>
Y'know, I really like how you still do this kinda stuff for
me, even now that we're married.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2988]
Oh, hey, while I'm thinking of it...
D'you know how to make Popcorn?
If you wanna give it a try, I'll teach ya.<wait><page>
It's super easy. All you need is Corn and a Frying Pan.
Heat it up, and bada bing, bada boom! Popcorn!<wait><page>
See. Toldja it was easy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2989]
Yo! What's up, <playername>?
Whatcha got there?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2990]
Wait... Holy crap, is that a Preserved Flower? Uh, yeah.
Can we go to your place to talk about this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2991]
Nice, a Preserved Flower. Better keep that stashed
away somewhere safe till you need it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2992]
YOOO. Whoa whoa whoa. Hold it.
Dude. Pal. Buddy. Friendo. Listen.<wait><page>
Let's not do this here, okay?
Can we go to your place instead?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2993]
Oh, hey. I recognize that. You gettin' ready to give it to
someone?<wait><page>
Niiice! So you've got a special so-and-so in your life, eh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2994]
Uh...okay, look. I'm sorry, but I don't feel that way for you
just yet, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2995]
Really? Cool. I'll be waitin'.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2996]
Really? Awww. Oh well.
If you can't, you can't.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2997]
Oh yeah! We're having a party tomorrow.
Why? Because Starlight Night. Duh.
Get home before 6:00 PM, 'kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2998]
Dude, I had no clue! I never would've guessed you're
carrying our baby right now. Man!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[2999]
Me...a dad! I still can't picture it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3000]
<nickname>, how are you feeling?<wait><page>
Lemme know if you need me to carry anything heavy or
get somethin' from the top shelf. That's why I'm here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3001]
I asked Doc what kindsa stuff I should be handlin' for
your sake. I mean, I'm a dad now! I've gotta act like one!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3002]
Is that a little baby bump I'm startin' to see?
Mini-Kai is gettin' bigger every day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3003]
I'm gonna do everything I can.
For both of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3004]
According to Doc, our baby will probably be born
tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3005]
He said he and Elly will be coming by, just in case.
How about you just kick back and rest for today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3006]
Man, babies have teeny hands. I love when they reach out
and grab hold of my pinky finger. It's so cute!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3007]
I wonder who <childname> takes after most...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3008]
Hm... Hmmm... HMMMMM...
...Okay, maybe I'm jumpin' the gun juuust a little.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3009]
Hey, what do you think <childname> will wanna be
as a grown-up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3010]
No matter what path our kid chooses to walk,
I hope it's a happy one. I'll do my best to make
sure of that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3011]
Hmm, I'm thinking we'll see <childname> start
walkin' soon. I've seen the little cutie almost
stand up a few times now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3012]
As soon as Operation Standing Baby is a success,
let's take 'em around the farm--oh, and out
to the beach, too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3013]
Man, kids shoot up so fast! At this rate, I'm gonna turn
around and find myself livin' with another grown-up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3014]
I'm always thinkin' about what I can do to be the best
dad for our kid at every stage of parenting.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3015]
Hey, is it me, or is <childname> starting to talk?
Can't really make out any words yet, but the effort's
there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3016]
I get the feeling that <childname> understands me,
but maybe not vice versa. Don'tcha think,
<nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3017]
...Hmm...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3018]
Yeah? What?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3019]
Hey, uh, is it me, or have you been givin' me the cold
shoulder lately?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3020]
C'mon, you're bein' colder than an off-season breeze at
the Beach Cafe! We've barely talked in...how long, now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3021]
<nickname>...
Do you hate me or something now?
What'd I do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3022]
Oh, phew. For a minute there, I was starting to think you
were avoiding me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3023]
Morning, <nickname>.
What's the plan for today?<wait><page>
I bet you've got a ton of stuff you've gotta do around
the farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3024]
Hm? How's the Beach Cafe doing?
Why don't you drop on by and find out?
Hint: it's going just fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3025]
Yo. Welcome home, <nickname>.
Headed back out to work some more?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3026]
Take it from me: you don't have to work THAT hard.
Going at your own speed and taking it easy is totally
valid.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3027]
Morning, <nickname>! Y'know, it's pretty nice
watchin' the sun come up on a farm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3028]
I've always loved summer best, but now I'm startin' to see
how other seasons are pretty cool in their own ways.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3029]
Welcome home, <nickname>.
Working late again, I see.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3030]
If you ever feel bushed, come on over to the Beach Cafe
for a snack. I'll hafta charge you regular price, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3031]
Morning, <nickname>. ∀
I'll do my best out there today if you promise
to do the same. Deal?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3032]
Yep, my wanderin' days are over.
I just can't see myself living without you anymore,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3033]
Yo, <nickname>. You're back.
How was your day? Anything cool happen?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3034]
We're family now, so you can tell me anything. I'm not
really into keeping secrets and stuff. Let's be open.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3035]
Yo. What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3036]
Dude, this Inn is great. It's cheap and the food's killer.
There's no place like it in any other town I've been to.<wait><page>
I look forward to staying here every year.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3037]
Popuri is a really sweet girl. She's kind and thoughtful
and always perky.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3038]
Now, if only we could avoid her friggin' nag of a big bro...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3039]
Man, Popuri's big bro is a royal pain in the butt. The
heck's that dude's problem?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3040]
He nitpicks and complains about every. Little. Thing. I get
real sick of it, real fast.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3041]
*sigh*<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3042]
Ugh. YOU try sitting through one of Rick's endless
tirades sometime.
You'll wanna gnaw your own leg off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3043]
If the dude's in love with me or something, I wish he'd just
come out and say it insteada bullying me like a kid.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3044]
Maaan, what a pain.
He's so dang serious, too...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3045]
Sheesh. I still don't get why Popuri has to be that jealous.<wait><page>
I guess there's a difference between dodging Rick to see
each other once a year and being together year-round.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3046]
You'd think staying here at the Inn on my own would
make things easier, right?<wait><page>
Wrong. Rick comes here too. He'll get a few drinks
downstairs, get tipsy... And then the claws REALLY come
out. Ugh.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3047]
Yo, <playername>. What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3048]
Man, I can hardly believe we're about to be married.<wait><page>
I wonder what you'll look like all decked out in a fancy
wedding dress? I can't even imagine it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3049]
Man, I can hardly believe we're about to be married.<wait><page>
I wonder what you'll look like all decked out in a fancy
tuxedo? I can't even imagine it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3050]
Yo! How's the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3051]
All work and no play makes for a dull <playername>,
y'know. How 'bout you take a break and hang out here
for a bit?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3052]
Yo! How's it going?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3053]
I know I'm only here during summer, but that's even more
reason for us to hang out sometime. How 'bout it?<wait><page>
It'd be pretty cool if we, y'know, got dinner here together
or something. Juuust sayin'.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3054]
Yo, <playername>.
Have you ever had the food here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3055]
Thinking about it, this place is kinda like my business rival
or whatever.<wait><page>
Maaan, how come I'm not getting more customers?
My food is definitely up to snuff, so... Hmm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3056]
Hm? Ah! Yo, <playername>!
Here to throw a few back?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3057]
You might not think it, but I'm pretty good at holding my
drinks. Wine's right up my alley. Betcha didn't know that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3058]
Yo, <playername>. How's the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3059]
Man, <playername>, you've really got it together.
Me? I don't. Not at all.
My Cafe's in rough shape and so am I.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3060]
Yo, <playername>. Working hard?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3061]
I've always run my Cafe kinda by the seat of my pants,
but watching you has made me wanna put more effort
into it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3062]
Yo, <playername>. What's shakin'?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3063]
It's weird. Lately, I've found myself kinda...looking out for
you around town. I wonder why.<wait><page>
I've never felt like this before.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3064]
Come by my Cafe sometime.
I'll roll out the red carpet for ya!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3065]
I'm only here during summer, y'know. Hangin' with me
is a special, limited-time experience!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3066]
Ah! <nickname>, you sure you should be out
and about?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3067]
When I first found out, I was like, "WHOA," but now that
I'm gonna be a dad, I've gotta get my crap together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3068]
Yo, <nickname>. How's <childname> doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3069]
Me, raising a kid... Who'da thunk it?
I never really saw it as my thing, but now that I'm knee-
deep, it's not so bad.<wait><page>
I used to think families and homes and stuff were nothing
but shackles, but I'm realizing that was just bias on my
part.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3070]
Sorry. I'm not in the mood to talk to you right now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3071]
Dude, just leave me alone!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3072]
Ah. <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3073]
Could you give me some space right now? I'm thinking
some stuff over.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3074]
Yo, <nickname>.
Come to watch the waves roll in too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3075]
The waters here are so vivid and clear.
I find myself losing track of time whenever I stare out
to sea.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3076]
Man, living together with you is great,
<nickname>. Every day is full of cool new
discoveries--about you, about US...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3077]
I've got a ton of respect for you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3078]
Man, I've GOTTA boost business at my Cafe somehow.
I don't wanna be outdone on the money front forever,
y'know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3079]
Dude, I am so glad I got to marry you, 
<nickname>. ∀  You're the pineAPPLE of my eye.
Heh.<wait><page>
Don't worry. I'll be home every night before it gets
too late. Promise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3080]
Dude, I am so glad I got to marry you, 
<nickname>. ∀  You're the pineAPPLE of my eye.
Heh.<wait><page>
Don't worry. I'll be home every night before it gets
too late. Promise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3081]
Marriage is cool, but it's not, like, the end-all, be-all
of relationships. What d'you think, <playername>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3082]
I s'pose it means something different to everyone.
If we both give it our best, I'm sure it'll work out
for us, eh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3083]
Yo, <playername>. How's it going? Everything okay
on the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3084]
Sometimes, I have to wonder if marriage just isn't
my bag.<wait><page>
Don't get me wrong--I don't regret it or anything,
but I can't help myself from thinking, y'know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3085]
It feels like time passes at more of a crawl here than it
does in the town where I live.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3086]
Yo! What's up?
Sorry, but I'm closed at the moment.<wait><page>
Relax and take it easy with me, eh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3087]
Aaah. The sea breeze here's like a snack for the soul.
Maybe I'll stay for more than just summer one of these
years.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3088]
What're YOU here for? If you don't need anything,
just get out, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3089]
Please.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3090]
Hey, uh, what would you do if I said I wanted to leave
Mineral Town?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3091]
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Don't take it seriously, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3092]
Welcome! Here for some grub?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3093]
Dude, are you seriously my only customer,
<nickname>? Uh...I think my Cafe might be in
trouble.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3094]
Welcome, <nickname>. Something up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3095]
Y'know, I was thinking... Wouldn't it be kinda cool to live
here at the Beach Cafe?<wait><page>
Personally, I'm happy no matter where I put down roots,
as long as I'm with you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3096]
Yo, <nickname>. ∀
Welcome. I'm glad to see you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3097]
Yo, <nickname>. ∀
Welcome. I'm glad to see you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3098]
My menu's always the same. I DID think about adding
dishes from other seasons, but since this is a Beach Cafe,
well...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3099]
Ah! Yo, <playername>. Welcome!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3100]
Hm? Where are the other customers? Funny you should
ask... Not many other people drop by. But meh, I don't let
it bug me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3101]
Yo! Welcome, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3102]
Come on in and hang out for a bit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3103]
Yo! How's it going?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3104]
It's friggin' blazin' out there, so don't push your luck with
the heat, ya hear me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3105]
Yo, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3106]
Y'know, nothing much ever happens here, so it's kiiinda
boring. But the people sure are nice!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3107]
Maaan, I'm getting, like, no customer traffic at all.
Maybe I should follow your example and take up
farming.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3108]
Just kidding! I already know I'm not cut out for that
stuff. I don't have the willpower you do,
<playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3109]
Hey, <playername>... D'you think you're gonna stay in
this town forever?<wait><page>
Why do I ask? Oh, no reason.
Just got curious, that's all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3110]
There are some other really nice places out there,
y'know. You should travel more. Really get a feel for
the world.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3111]
I love summer, so as soon as the season's over here,
I move on to the next town where summer's blazin'.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3112]
Hey, <playername>, do YOU like summer? If you didn't
have that farm tying you down, I'd take you to all kindsa
places.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3113]
Yo, <playername>. Maaan, you're practically my only
customer, aren't you? It's kinda sad...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3114]
I mean, it's not great business-wise, but I kinda like having
only you around. No, seriously. I do.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3115]
Yo. Welcome, <playername>.
Farm life treatin' you right?<wait><page>
Me? Well, the Cafe's dead as usual, but it's nice to be
able to take it easy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3116]
Y'know, I'm starting to wanna hang around this town
more. It's just boring when you aren't around.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3117]
I'm gonna head out to work.
I'll be back before it gets too late.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3118]
Yo. What's up? Need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3119]
Welp, that's another day of hard work and good fun in
the bag.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3120]
Business is, well... It's not much better than usual.
But it's all good. Things'll work out in the end.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3121]
I'd better get to work. See you tonight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3122]
Hey, whoa. You're gonna make me late to work.
I promise I'll be home on time tonight, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3123]
Yo. Evenin'! You wrapping up work for the day too,
<nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3124]
When you think of work as...well, work, it somehow feels
more tiring. Hm? Have I not been doing that all along?<wait><page>
Well... Kinda yes, kinda no? I guess it's the weight of
responsibility that I'm noticing more these days.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3125]
I've gotta take off.
Watch things while I'm gone, 'kay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3126]
It's such an awesome feeling to know that someone will
be waiting for me when I come home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3127]
Yo, <nickname>. Didja come to pick me up from
work? Aw, you didn't have to. ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3128]
I mean, yeah, it's kinda embarrassing, but it DOES make
me happy...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3129]
Um, s-so, uh, I'm taking off... Man, it feels weird saying
that to someone.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3130]
There's just something about family that makes me all
warm 'n fuzzy. Heck, just saying the word makes my
heart race!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3131]
Hey, uh... Babe, I-I'm home...
Geez, that feels so weird to say.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3132]
I'm still learning the ropes with the whole husband thing.
Gotta remember how to talk like one! Haha.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3133]
Welp, I'm off to the Beach Cafe!
I'll be back later tonight. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3134]
Welp, I'm off to the Beach Cafe!
I'll be back later tonight. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3135]
Man, it feels so weird heading out like I'm going to an
office or something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3136]
I was just getting ready to head home. You finished with
work for the day too, <nickname>? ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3137]
I was just getting ready to head home. You finished with
work for the day too, <nickname>? ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3138]
It's nice to have a house to go home to,
but the Beach Cafe is my home too.
Ah well. I'll get used to it eventually.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3139]
Haha! It's finally my season to shine! Hope I'll be seein'
you at the Fetch Fest, <playername>!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3140]
I'm so stoked for tomorrow's Fetch Fest! Beaches have
been my stomping grounds for as long as I can remember.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3141]
I am ALWAYS here for a good fireworks show!
Let's make some noise tomorrow!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3142]
Moonlight Night, huh...? Man, that's actually kind of a
bummer for me... Makes it feel like summer's officially
over.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3143]
Hm? Haven't seen you before.<wait><page>
Huh. So you're the new owner of that farm? I'm Gray.
Nice to meet you.<wait><page>
There's absolutely nothing around here. You...do know
that, right? Don't tell me you're some kinda earth weirdo.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3144]
Oh! Huh? Is this a birthday present?<wait><page>
So you remembered, <nickname>. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3145]
Wh-Whoa! You just about scared me outta my boots
there. What's up?<wait><page>
Is this...a birthday present?
Wow, thanks. That's nice of you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3146]
Heck yeah. That smells great. Thanks. 
I can't get enough of this stuff.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3147]
Oh, thanks! Guess you know me well, huh?<wait><page>
I'm so glad I married you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3148]
Oh, thanks! Gotta say, it's nice to have friends who have
your back.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3149]
Thanks, <nickname>. I wouldn't mind gettin'
another one of these sometime. Heh.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3150]
Lucky me! Y'know, if you ever wanted to give me one of
these again sometime... Heh.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3151]
Thanks, <nickname>. I'll take it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3152]
Oh, thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3153]
Nah. Pass. I thought you knew that wasn't my kinda thing,
<nickname>.<wait><page>
Well, now you do, I guess.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3154]
Uh, I guess I'll take it, but just so you know, I'm not exactly
jumpin' up and down about it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3155]
The heck's this, <nickname>?<wait><page>
Y'know, there's a line you shouldn't cross when it comes
to stupid pranks. You're startin' to tick me off.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3156]
Okay, now you've REALLY got me heated. Knock this
crap off and stop messin' with me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3157]
Coming all this way to show me that...
You're friggin' cute, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3158]
Coming all this way to show me that...
You're friggin' cute.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3159]
Whoa! Get outta here with that, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3160]
Whoa! Get outta here with that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3161]
That's one of Grandpa's creations, right? Huh.
Thanks, <nickname>.<wait><page>
Actually, this'll encourage me to keep training until
I can make something this good. Or better, even.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3162]
Grandpa made that, huh? Thanks. I'll take it. Maybe I'll
learn something from inspectin' his craftsmanship.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3163]
Oh, <nickname>.
Wait, this isn't yours?<wait><page>
Thanks. I'll give it to my mom or something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3164]
Hey, that looks nice.
You're giving it to me?<wait><page>
Guess I'll give it to my mom or something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3165]
That's a pretty thoughtful present. You're smooth.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3166]
Oh, perfume. If you don't want it, <nickname>,
I'll take it.<wait><page>
Thanks. I'll give it to my mom or something.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3167]
Huh? Wait, <nickname>... I thought guys were
supposed to give chocolate today?<wait><page>
Well, guess I shouldn't complain. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3168]
W-Wait, is today...? Huh?<wait><page>
Uh, not sure exactly what's goin' on, but I'll take it
anyway. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3169]
Uhhh, I dunno what's goin' on, but...thanks?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3170]
So you DID get me something.
Thanks. Really, I'm glad.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3171]
Oh, hey. For me?<wait><page>
Thanks! Nice of you to do that even though I didn't get
YOU anything for White Day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3172]
Oh, you didn't have to return the favor. I'm glad you did,
though. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3173]
Whoa! L-Let's bring the heat down a notch. We're kinda
in public here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3174]
Who're you gonna give that to? I hope it works out
for you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3175]
Y'know, you really shouldn't mess with people like that.
Not cool. Huh? You didn't mean it as a joke?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3176]
Uhhh... Sorry, but I don't think I'm ready to take that step
with you yet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3177]
What? Somethin' on your mind?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3178]
Yeaaah, no. If I cut into my training with a part-time job,
Grandpa'd chew me out somethin' fierce.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3179]
Um... Tomorrow's Starlight Night.
I'm gonna be preppin' a feast, so...<wait><page>
Would you wanna have a party at your place,
<playername>? You've gotta be lonely all by
yourself, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3180]
Um... Tomorrow's Starlight Night.
I'm gonna be preppin' a feast, so...<wait><page>
Would you wanna have a party at your place,
<playername>? You've gotta be lonely all by
yourself, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3181]
Let's have Saibara over too.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3182]
Huh? Grandpa? Y'know, you're right.
We should invite him too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3183]
Cool. See you at the Forge after 6:00 PM tomorrow.
Just swing by when you're done working.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3184]
Oh... Okay.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3185]
Tomorrow's Starlight Night, so we're gonna have
a party. I've gotta put my blood, sweat, and tears
into a feast.<wait><page>
No, not literally. I just meant that I've got a lotta work
to do. Make sure you come home hungry tomorrow, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3186]
There's a little baby inside you right now, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3187]
We've gotta do everything we can to keep 'em safe.
I wonder when the big day'll be?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3188]
I'm gonna be a dad.
Get it together, Gray.
Get. It. Together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3189]
I wonder if the baby'll be a boy or a girl? Honestly, I don't
really care either way, so long as they're healthy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3190]
Your belly's really starting to show.
It feels like it'll be any day now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3191]
But don't push yourself, okay?
Take your work one step at a time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3192]
At the Clinic, they said the baby could be born tomorrow,
so Doctor and Elly will be hunkering down with us here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3193]
We'll finally be meeting our kid.
I wonder what kinda person they'll grow up to be?
Can't wait to find out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3194]
<childname> just cries, cries, cries all day and night,
huh? What should we do?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3195]
Being a parent is tough. It's completely different from
what I imagined.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3196]
You're so good at putting <childname> to bed,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3197]
Holding <childname> makes me feel like a newbie
smith holding his first hammer.
Like, "Why are you crying THIS time?"<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3198]
It's looking like <childname> is almost ready to
stand. It could be any day now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3199]
And talking'll come soon after that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3200]
Now that <childname>'s big enough to stand up,
I wanna go somewhere as a family soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3201]
Finally showing <childname> what the world looks
like outside these four walls is gonna be a real treat.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3202]
I can mostly understand what <childname> is
saying now. I'm getting better at reading body language
and stuff too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3203]
Maybe I'll try making some toys at the Forge.
I'm sure <childname> would love having
something Dad made himself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3204]
...
...
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3205]
Let's just be honest here. You don't care about me,
do you, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3206]
...I just can't understand what's goin' through your head
recently, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3207]
I know the farm is important, but I coulda sworn we
exchanged vows to spend time together and stuff. C'mon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3208]
Do you hate me now or something, <nickname>?<wait><page>
Be honest. I can take it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3209]
We haven't been talking as much. This isn't how a
husband and wife are supposed to act.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3210]
We haven't been talking as much. This isn't how husbands
are supposed to act.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3211]
Oh, <nickname>. Morning. Living on a farm means
you rise with the sun, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3212]
The Forge doesn't open until later, so I'm not much
of a morning person.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3213]
Welcome back. Are you done working?
Or are you gonna keep at it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3214]
It must be rough working so late.
Is that why you're so buff?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3215]
Morning, <nickname>.
Work up a good sweat out there today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3216]
I'm not a master smith yet, but I'm getting there,
one step at a time.<wait><page>
I've gotta keep up with you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3217]
Welcome home. You wiped out after today?
Or are you still rarin' to go?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3218]
Hey, be careful not to trip and hurt yourself if you're
gonna work through the night. Your tools holdin' up okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3219]
Morning, <nickname>. ∀ How're you feeling today?
Catch enough z's?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3220]
Before we got married, <nickname>, I never
imagined I'd be living on a farm like this. Life has a way...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3221]
Before we got married, <nickname>, I never
imagined I'd be living on a farm. Life sure likes to take its
turns, doesn't it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3222]
Welcome home, <nickname>. ∀
The hustle never stops, eh?
Be careful out there when it gets dark.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3223]
Compared to before we lived together, I don't have to
worry about you as much, since I'm never too far away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3224]
Compared to before we lived together, I don't have to
worry about you as much, since I'm never too far away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3225]
Huh? Fancy seeing you here, babe.
Were you workin' nearby?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3226]
Try not to come home too late, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3227]
Ugh, I hate the countryside.
There's absolutely nothin' around.
Do you seriously like it here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3228]
Ugh, I've got way too much free time and nothin' to do
with it. I wanna go back to the city. Don't you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3229]
Hey, <playername>. You know that girl who works at
the Library?<wait><page>
Whaddaya think of her?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3230]
Hey, <playername>. You know that girl who works at
the Library?<wait><page>
Whaddaya think of her?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3231]
I'm making an effort to visit the Library more often.
Been in a reading sorta mood lately.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3232]
Can't believe it took me this long to realize how
interesting books could be.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3233]
Apparently, Marie's a novelist.
Talk about amazing.<wait><page>
Knowing how hard she works on her novels makes ME
wanna work hard too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3234]
Yo. You look like you're keepin' busy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3235]
You think I'm happier recently, huh? Well, you ain't wrong.
It's almost like a fog has lifted, honestly.<wait><page>
I'm plannin' to put everything I've got into my smithing
work from here on out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3236]
Marie's different from other girls somehow.<wait><page>
It's like...I want her to notice me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3237]
Right now, my life is pretty much just work, read, sleep,
repeat. For some reason, though, I'm kinda into it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3238]
Marie's dad is always telling me the most fascinating,
out-there stories.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3239]
Reading is great and all, but smithing is my passion.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3240]
Oh, hey, <playername>. The wedding's coming up
pretty soon, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3241]
Still can't really believe it's happening. I never thought
I'd get married before I'd mastered my craft.<wait><page>
But believe me, I'm countin' the days. Heh.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3242]
Oh, <playername>. The wedding's coming up pretty
soon, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3243]
Still can't really believe it's happening. I never thought
I'd get married before I'd mastered my craft.<wait><page>
But believe me, I'm countin' the days. Heh.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3244]
Oh, you need something from me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3245]
Work has a way of totally throwin' off your whole day
when things don't go right, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3246]
Hey hey. How's the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3247]
I'm doin'...okay.
Like, not great, but not bad, either.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3248]
Hey, how're your tools? You're not using 'em while
they're damaged, are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3249]
Drop by the store again. Keep in mind that I'm still in
training, so I can't personally do much for you yet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3250]
You live alone, right?
You don't feel, like...vulnerable at night?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3251]
You live alone, right?
You don't feel, like...vulnerable at night?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3252]
Wow. You're tough, <playername>.<wait><page>
You're a little different from the other girls I know.
And that's a good thing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3253]
Wow. You're tough, <playername>.<wait><page>
You're a little different from the other guys I know.
And that's a good thing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3254]
Oh, <playername>.
You knockin' those farm chores out?<wait><page>
If there's anything I can do to help, just lemme know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3255]
Oh, <playername>.
You knockin' those farm chores out?<wait><page>
If there's anything I can do to help, just lemme know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3256]
I'm starting to enjoy my training.
B-But it's not like I'm not takin' it seriously or anything.<wait><page>
I've got you checking in on me, after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3257]
Seeing everything YOU do gives me the motivation to give
it my all too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3258]
Seeing everything YOU do gives me the motivation to give
it my all too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3259]
Not that farming and smithing are anything alike.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3260]
You're amazing, <playername>.
Even though you live alone, you never get discouraged.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3261]
You're amazing, <playername>.
Even though you live alone, you never get discouraged.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3262]
I just think that's cool as heck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3263]
I just think that's cool as heck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3264]
No matter what I do, Grandpa always criticizes me.
I can't stand it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3265]
Come to think of it, how old IS Grandpa, anyway?<wait><page>
I can't believe he's still spry as a spring chicken. Weird.
What's his secret?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3266]
Huh? What's up? You need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3267]
Shouldn't you be getting home?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3268]
Marie's parents are so nice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3269]
Grandpa's lightened up a bit recently. He doesn't yell at
me as often.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3270]
I never imagined I'd be a dad.<wait><page>
I've gotta keep working hard.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3271]
You shouldn't push yourself, though, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3272]
Welcome, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3273]
How's <childname>? Unfortunately, this place's
off-limits since there's too much dangerous stuff.
Like fire.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3274]
Welcome, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3275]
Sorry, but I wanna focus on my work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3276]
Hey, welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3277]
I'm working right now. Shh.
I need to concentrate, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3278]
Oh, <nickname>. Here for some tool repair?
You've gotta show 'em to Grandpa, not me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3279]
I'm working right now, so let's talk later.
Oh, hey, don't get me wrong. I'm really happy
you came to see me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3280]
Hey, <nickname>. How's the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3281]
Work's rough--I know--but let's both do our best. I'll do
everything I can for your sake too, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3282]
Welcome. How're you feeling, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3283]
Marrying you is one of the best decisions I've ever made.
You make me wanna work harder than ever.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3284]
Welcome. How're things going at the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3285]
It must be nice to have a family.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3286]
Grandpa just won't recognize me as a full-fledged
blacksmith.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3287]
I wanna make an accessory for Marie someday. That's
why I'm doing the best I can.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3288]
Hey, welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3289]
How's work?<wait><page>
Balancing work and family ain't easy.
I'm doin' the best I can here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3290]
Oh, you need something from me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3291]
You work pretty hard for someone who lives on their
own, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3292]
You work pretty hard for someone who lives on their
own, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3293]
Welcome, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3294]
Welcome, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3295]
What's it like living on a farm?<wait><page>
Seeing everything you do makes me feel like I've gotta
step up my game.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3296]
What's it like living on a farm?<wait><page>
Seeing everything you do makes me feel like I've gotta
step up my game.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3297]
Welcome. What're you here for today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3298]
I wish I could just get good at this already. Work with me
here, hands...!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3299]
Oh, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3300]
Oh, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3301]
The farm life must be rough as heck.
Even Grandpa's impressed by how well you're holdin'
everything together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3302]
Oh, welcome, <playername>.
Everything at the farm goin'...farmingly?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3303]
Oh, welcome, <playername>.
Everything at the farm goin'...farmingly?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3304]
Still can't believe one person can pull off everything you
do, <playername>. Honestly, I think it's amazing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3305]
Still can't believe one person can pull off everything you
do, <playername>. Honestly, I think it's amazing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3306]
Oh, <playername>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3307]
Oh, <playername>. Welcome.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3308]
Isn't there, like, a never-endin' list of chores to do around
a farm? It sounds hard. And you're not lonely?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3309]
<playername>. Welcome.
I'm crankin' up the heat on my training.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3310]
<playername>. Welcome.
I'm crankin' up the heat on my training.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3311]
It'd be really cool if you bought one of my creations
someday, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3312]
It'd be really cool if you bought one of my creations
someday, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3313]
Got bitten by the reading bug too, eh, <nickname>?<wait><page>
This place isn't very well-known, but there's a lotta solid
literature here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3314]
If you find a good book, let me know. It might help me
discover what I'm lacking.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3315]
"Books are love! Books are life!"
Heard someone say that once.
Can't say I disagree at this point.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3316]
Marie's like a never-ending source of good book
recommendations.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3317]
Oh, hey, <nickname>. I don't usually see you here.
What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3318]
I'm here as part of my training.
The hardest part is reflecting upon my weaknesses
so I can improve.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3319]
Before, I felt like I was being forced to come up here, but
it's different with Marie.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3320]
It's like...I can't focus my mind unless I lose some of this
tension first.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3321]
On our days off, Grandpa makes me climb the mountain.
He says it's to help me develop a sharper sense of focus.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3322]
Focus... Focus...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3323]
I wonder what kind of fireworks they're preparing for
tomorrow's Fireworks Festival?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3324]
You planning on going to Moonlight Night, too? Believe it
or not, I'm really looking forward to it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3325]
The Autumn Derby's coming up. You should definitely go if
you have the chance.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3326]
I have a real good feeling about this Derby. I'm gonna win
something for sure. Though, I say that every year, and
I've yet to get lucky...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3327]
We don't just celebrate sheep at the Fluffy Festival, you
know. There's usually a good lineup of alpacas and Angora
rabbits, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3328]
The Fluffy Festival may not be the most exciting festival
in the world, but I'm still interested to find out who
wins it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3329]
Tomorrow, we get to celebrate this past year with the
whole town. I'm really looking forward to that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3330]
You're an unfamiliar face around these parts.
...Ah, so you're the new caretaker of that farm. I see.<wait><page>
It must be difficult to manage a farm with only one set
of hands, but do your best out there.<wait><page>
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.
The name's Saibara. Nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3331]
Ahem.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3332]
Hahaha, I can't believe I'm still getting birthday presents
at my age. Thank you. I'll take it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3333]
Mmm, I'm grateful. You've got real respect for your
elders, kid. Thanks for thinking of an old-timer like me. <wait><page>
Gray could learn a thing or two from you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3334]
Well, thank you. I'll happily take it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3335]
Ah, a gift. I'll take it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3336]
Sorry, but I have no need for this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3337]
Just what are you trying to pull?!
Ugh. Kids these days need to mind their manners.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3338]
Such a tiny creature, and yet it faces every day with
mighty vitality. It's a reminder to live mindfully.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3339]
Urgh... Sorry, but I'm busy right now.
Go show that to someone else.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3340]
What, are you unsatisfied with my craftsmanship?
All sales are final.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3341]
Mmm... And what, exactly, am I supposed to do with this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3342]
Ho ho, now that's not something you see every day.
Is that perfume?<wait><page>
What, exactly, is the point of wearing something like that,
anyway?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3343]
You should be giving this to some nice young man,
not an old-timer like me.<wait><page>
You're an odd one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3344]
Oh, before I forget, I'll teach you how to make something
called a Winter Sun.<wait><page>
If you feel like making it, commit what I'm about to tell
you to memory.<wait><page>
The required ingredients are: Moonstone, Sandrose,
Emerald, Diamond...<wait><page>
...and although they're hard to come by, you'll also need
Pink Diamond, Alexandrite, and Mythic Ore.<wait><page>
You won't need any kitchen tools.
Just put all the ingredients together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3345]
I see. A Blue Feather, hm?<wait><page>
No need to waste time showing me.
Go on and give it to the one you love.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3346]
Ho ho, <playername>.
Is little <childname> well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3347]
I have a great-grandchild now.<wait><page>
Perhaps I'll continue clinging to these old bones until
I can see <childname> get married. Ho ho.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3348]
How's married life treating you?<wait><page>
I'm concerned that you might have your hands full with
that greenhorn grandson of mine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3349]
How's married life treating you?<wait><page>
I'm concerned that you might have your hands full with
that greenhorn grandson of mine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3350]
...That so?<wait><page>
I guess Gray's finally pulled himself together now that
he's someone's husband.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3351]
...That so?<wait><page>
I guess Gray's finally pulled himself together now that
he's someone's husband.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3352]
The early bird catches the worm.
Folks have been saying that for eons.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3353]
Productive mornings are crucial when it comes to farm
work. If you sleep in, you're not fit to be a farmer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3354]
Do you need something?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3355]
Hohoho. There's no point in standing around here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3356]
All is well in your world, I trust?
Whatever life throws at you, devote yourself to it fully
every day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3357]
To live is to learn. Never forget that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3358]
Morning. Nice weather we're having.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3359]
Oh ho. Hello, <playername>.
I'm going shopping.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3360]
I'm about to go take a load off.
If you wouldn't turn your nose up at an old man's
company, you should come with.<wait><page>
Those who work hard need to relax in equal measure.
The body requires rest.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3361]
Time to head back home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3362]
*ahem* You seem to be doing well.
Try not to work yourself too hard.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3363]
You're a funny one.
What do you need with this old man, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3364]
Oh ho. Hello, <playername>.
I came to buy ingredients for supper.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3365]
When my spouse passed away, I had no idea how
to take care of myself. These days, I'm a little more
self-sufficient.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3366]
<playername>. Are you done working?<wait><page>
I always take a hot bath after work.
It's part of my daily routine now.<wait><page>
At my age, I don't think it's such a bad habit to have.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3367]
Even Gray's expressed concern for my health. It's a bit
embarrassing to have him fuss over me, but I'm glad he
cares.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3368]
Oh ho, it's <playername>.
Will you have a drink with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3369]
Gray has changed since he married you.
He regards both me and his training with a different
attitude now.<wait><page>
He's almost like a completely different person...though he
still has some maturing to do.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3370]
Have you ever tried any of the drinks here,
<playername>?<wait><page>
If you haven't, you ought to.
At least once.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3371]
Ever tried rice milk? I have, and let me tell you, it stands
on equal footing with the drinks here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3372]
Oh ho. Hello, <playername>.
It's such a nice night.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3373]
I'm at that age now, you now. I have a duty to teach Gray
everything I know before I leave this world behind.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3374]
Ugh, that grandson of mine...<wait><page>
Now that he's married, he refuses to climb the mountain
with me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3375]
Hmph. You know what? I lived just fine by myself before
he came. In fact, it's refreshing to be left alone!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3376]
Ahem. Are you climbing the mountain as well,
<playername>?<wait><page>
On Thursdays, I always close the store and hike up here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3377]
Make sure you relax from time to time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3378]
What's the matter?
Is all well on the farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3379]
Don't you think you should quit wasting time here and
focus on your farm work instead?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3380]
You're a hard worker yourself.
I can see how much you've grown.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3381]
I'm getting on in years, you know.
I need to name my successor soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3382]
Hmm, the Mochi Bonanza's tomorrow, is it? Hopefully
these aching joints can still pound mochi.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3383]
What do you think, <playername>? Any inkling of
who's going to win the Spring Derby?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3384]
So, about that Derby tomorrow... Who are you placing
your bets on, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3385]
Come to think of it, we've got the Cluck-Cluck Clash
coming up, don't we?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3386]
Coming to the Cluck-Cluck Clash tomorrow? I'll be headed
over there first thing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3387]
What do you think, <playername>? Any inkling of
who's going to win the Autumn Derby?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3388]
So, about that Derby tomorrow... I'm going to place my
bets on--hrm. Actually, perhaps it'd be best to keep that
a secret.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3389]
End of the year again, eh? When you're as old as I am,
a year goes by in the blink of an eye.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3390]
Hn? And who're you?<wait><page>
Ah. Moved into that old farmhouse, didja? Name's Gotts.
I'm the carpenter 'round these parts.<wait><page>
If you wanna spruce that old farmhouse up,
you come see me. I'll build whatever ya want,
as long as ya pay for it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3391]
You...you got me a birthday present?
I, uh... I dunno what to say. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3392]
Well, ain't you a thoughtful one!
Thanks! 'Preciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3393]
Aha! Now that's the ticket. Thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3394]
Aah, sorry to put ya out. 'Preciate it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3395]
Hn? What's this for? A present?
Whaddaya want me to do with it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3396]
Huh? I don't need any of that crap.
Here, take it back. C'mon.
...Why won't ya take it back?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3397]
Gahaha! I see these little guys out on the mountain every
day, y'know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3398]
Wh-Wh-What the heck?!
I 'bout jumped outta my skin there!
Knock it off!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3399]
If my little girl was still alive, she'd be at about that age
when she'd wanna wear this kinda stuff.<wait><page>
Aha. I know. Maybe I'll give it to that Karen girl over at
the General Store.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3400]
That's the spittin' image of somethin' my late wife used
to have.<wait><page>
Aha. I know. Maybe I'll give it to that Karen girl over at
the General Store.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3401]
Uhhh... What's goin' on? I'm confused.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3402]
Huh. Thanks. You're 'bout the only one who ever thinks of
givin' me chocolate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3403]
Ever hearda Okonomiyaki? Now THAT'S the good stuff.
Simple, too. All ya gotta do is mix the ingredients
together.<wait><page>
If you want, I'll teach ya the recipe.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3404]
So, yeah, lessee...
First, you start with some Wheat Flour, right?<wait><page>
Then, you add some Cabbage. Maybe a little Mochi
if you're feelin' fancy. And you'll need an Egg, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3405]
You whip all that stuff together, then Oil up your
Fryin' Pan and cook till golden-brown.<wait><page>
Whoops, almost forgot! You'll wanna chop that Cabbage
up with your Knife first. And there ya have it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3406]
Gettin' married, huh? Keep that new family of yours safe,
y'hear?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3407]
Now, this is just a rumor an' all, but I hear
<linkedfarmname> Farm has got some amazing
construction goin' on.<wait><page>
I'd like to go see it sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3408]
Some years ago, an old coot by the name o' Chuu
used to live with me.<wait><page>
Loved to collect and study bugs and bees and stuff.
Somethin' 'bout Mineral Town's insects really fascinated
him.<wait><page>
Saw him take off chasing a butterfly one day, and poof.
Gone. He ain't come back yet. How far did he follow
that thing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3409]
Yo. Sorry, but I'm not on the clock right now.
Won't take no commissions. Them's the rules.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3410]
Hm? Well, if ya ain't here on business, then what ARE ya
here for?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3411]
Oh. It's just you, <playername>.
Ah, sorry.<wait><page>
I didn't mean that to be rude or nothin'.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3412]
Now, I LIKE livin' way out here by myself, but sometimes,
when it's real quiet, I'll see some weird stuff.<wait><page>
What, ya gettin' scared? Then scoot on home 'fore it gets
too dark.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3413]
You be careful when you climb that mountain alone,
ya hear me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3414]
It ain't like there're bears or wolves, but it don't hurt to
be cautious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3415]
Yo. Looks like you're keepin' busy.
Good luck with everything.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3416]
Yo. I'm lookin' for some good trees to turn into lumber.
Figured I'd forage for some stuff to eat while I'm at it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3417]
A friendly tip: if you're thinkin' of chopping down some
trees, don't just go out there and start whackin' away.<wait><page>
Have some respect and take only what ya need.
The mountain is sharin' her bounty with us humans,
after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3418]
Yo. I was just headed off to see the mayor. Been a while,
so I thought I'd say hey and catch up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3419]
Yo. I come on down into town on Saturdays. Y'know,
to get some eggs and milk, run errands, stuff like that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3420]
Been up on the mountain for a while now. I'd go nuts
if I didn't come down and be social with folks sometimes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3421]
Yo, <playername>. How's work?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3422]
Keep makin' your farm bigger and better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3423]
Yo, <playername>.
You like this spot too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3424]
Lost my family here some years back.<wait><page>
Basil likes bringin' his family up this way for hikes. That's
fine and all, but I ask him not to when it's snowy out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3425]
You be careful, too, <playername>.
Ya hear me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3426]
Hm... Ah. <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3427]
You'd better head on back down 'fore too long.
It's gettin' dark.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3428]
Yo. Things are comin' along nicely.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3429]
Just kick back and relax.
I'll have it done in a jiff.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3430]
Spendin' as much time out here alone as I do, sometimes
I'll see some really out-there stuff.<wait><page>
When I get home, I always stop and think to myself,
"Did that really happen? Or was I just dreamin'?"<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3431]
If you're gonna go up the mountain, make sure ya come
back down before sunset. It's dangerous up there in the
dark.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3432]
Lots of folks say there's supposed to be a Goddess livin'
up on this mountain, but I ain't never seen her.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3433]
If you ever do see that Goddess, couldja tell her Gotts
says hi? Tell her I'm thankful for all the mountain gives
me.<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3434]
Oh, yeah. Nearly forgot it was the Mochi Bonanza
tomorrow. Guess I'll drag myself over there if I've gotta.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3435]
Cookin' Exhibition's comin' up, you say?
That'll be a fun one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3436]
Cookin' Exhibition's tomorrow, right? Great.
Can't wait to finally eat some decent grub for once.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3437]
Hm. Guess I could bring a few mushrooms from the
mountain for the Harvest Festival.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3438]
Harvest Festival's tomorrow. It's a real fun time,
gatherin' 'round the giant pot with the whole town.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3439]
You gonna be racin' in the upcomin' Derby? I'm goin'
either way, so I wouldn't mind cheerin' ya on.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3440]
Tomorrow's Derby is gonna be a darn good time.
Y'know what's not a darn good time, though?
Tryin' to pick which horse to bet on...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3441]
A few more days and it'll be the Fluffy Festival, right?
You enterin' any of your furry friends?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3442]
Lookin' at animals is pretty calmin' to me, so I'm eager to
watch the Fluffy Festival.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3443]
Tomorrow, you'll be able to eat all the soba noodles you
want. Just don't get too carried away.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3444]
Hi there, lady. You a traveler?<wait><page>
Whaaat?! You moved onto that farm?!
Neat! I live on one too.<wait><page>
I'm Mei. Nice to meetcha, lady.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3445]
Hi there, mister. You a traveler?<wait><page>
Whaaat?! You moved onto that farm?!
Neat! I live on one too.<wait><page>
I'm Mei. Nice to meetcha, mister.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3446]
Yaaay, thanks! A present from Mommy arrived today too,
y'know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3447]
Though I kinda wish she'd just come to see me instead...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3448]
Wow! Thanks, lady!
I'll show it to Grandpa later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3449]
Wow! Thanks, mister!
I'll show it to Grandpa later.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3450]
Wow, thanks. This is nice.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3451]
Thanks, lady.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3452]
Thanks, mister.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3453]
I don't like this.
But don't tell Grandpa, okay?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3454]
Do I reeeally hafta take this?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3455]
Awww! Who's a little cutie?
You are! You are! Hee hee!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3456]
Eek! You're a big meanie!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3457]
Eek! You're a big meanie!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3458]
Whoa... You're gonna give that to me?<wait><page>
Yaaay! I'll wear it forever and ever.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3459]
Whoa... You're gonna give that to me?<wait><page>
Yaaay! I'll wear it forever and ever.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3460]
Whoa... Really? For me?<wait><page>
Yaaay! I'll wear it when I grow up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3461]
Whoa... Really? For me?<wait><page>
Yaaay! I'll wear it when I grow up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3462]
Wooow, perfume! I know about it 'cuz Mommy
wore it a lot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3463]
Whoa, sooo pretty. Um, what is it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3464]
Hey, guess what? The other day, I talked with Mommy on
the phone!<wait><page>
She sounded happy.
I wonder when she'll come back?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3465]
I heard they sell a giant stuffed teddy bear
in Forgotten Valley.<wait><page>
Also, also, it MOVES sometimes! Doesn't that sound
SO cool? I wish I had one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3466]
Hello there, lady.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3467]
Hello there, mister.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3468]
Grandpa's real busy and his legs aren't so good,
so he can't play with me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3469]
Whenever I mention Mommy to Grandpa, he gets all
quiet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3470]
When Grandpa looks sad or gets angry, it makes me
wanna cry too.<wait><page>
But then Grandpa always tells me that I'm a good girl.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3471]
Awww, the weather's super icky today.
I can't go outside on days like this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3472]
I caught a cold before 'cuz I went out when it was
raining.<wait><page>
And then Grandpa told me I wasn't allowed to go out in
the rain ever again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3473]
I hope it's sunny tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3474]
Night night, lady.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3475]
Night night, mister.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3476]
I dream a lot about sleeping in a place where there's a
buuunch of sheep.<wait><page>
It feels sooo fluffy! 
I love those dreams.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3477]
I dream a lot about sleeping in a place where there's a

I love those dreams.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3478]
Someday, I really wanna try sleeping on a sheep juuust
once. ...G'night.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3479]
Today's the day Grandpa goes to the Hot Spring.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3480]
But I hate that place!
It's waaay too hot.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3481]
Oh, lady! Hi there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3482]
Oh, mister! Hi there.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3483]
I heard there's a field of flowers somewhere waaay
above here.<wait><page>
But I can't go see 'cuz Grandpa says it's dangerous.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3484]
Hello there, lady.<wait><page>
Don'tcha think Mr. Carter's super nice?<wait><page>
He talks with me lots, and the snacks he makes
are sooo yummy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3485]
Hello there, mister.<wait><page>
Don'tcha think Mr. Carter's super nice?<wait><page>
He talks with me lots, and the snacks he makes
are sooo yummy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3486]
I like Yu too, but...
Sometimes, I really hate him, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3487]
Oh, hi, lady. Play with me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3488]
Oh, hi, mister. Play with me!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3489]
You've got work to do? Awww...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3490]
Work, work, work.
Adults are always so busy working.<wait><page>
But then how come Carter has time to play with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3491]
I love the animals here.
You do too, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3492]
I love the animals here.
You do too, huh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3493]
Grandpa talks with the animals a lot.<wait><page>
I wonder if I'll be able to talk with them when I get
bigger too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3494]
Hey, do you know about my mommy?<wait><page>
She's real nice, just like you.
Except she's gone right now.
But I'm sure she'll come to visit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3495]
Hey, do you know about my mommy?<wait><page>
She's real nice, just like you.
Except she's gone right now.
But I'm sure she'll come to visit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3496]
Grandpa talks to me about a buncha things.<wait><page>
I get kinda sleepy when I listen to him sometimes, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3497]
I wanna pound the Mochi, too! I looove Mochi! It's so good!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3498]
Do you like horses, lady? You do?! I do, too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3499]
Do you like horses, mister? You do?! I do, too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3500]
Tomorrow, we'll be able to see sooo many horses!
I can't wait!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3501]
I think the Moo-Moo Festival will be here soon!
What kinds of cows d'you think are gonna be there?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3502]
Grandpa always gets reeeal busy right before the
Moo-Moo Festival, so I wanna work hard and help
him, too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3503]
Are you gonna be in the Concert too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3504]
Are you gonna be in the Concert too?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3505]
I love listenin' to music! What kinda music's gonna be at
tomorrow's Concert? Do you know?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3506]
It's gonna be the Fluffy Festival soon! Staring at
a sheep's eyes can be kinda scary, but they're
super duper cute!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3507]
Grandpa's gonna be super busy during the Fluffy Festival
tomorrow... So I probably will be, too!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3508]
Oh ho, so you're <playername>.<wait><page>
My name's Mugi. Nice to meet you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3509]
What? A birthday present?<wait><page>
Haha... So that's why Mei picked some flowers and gave
them to me earlier.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3510]
This is my favorite. Thank you.
I gratefully accept.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3511]
What is all this about? You don't have to pay me any
special mind. I do appreciate it, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3512]
Thanks. I'll take it off your hands.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3513]
Erm, thanks...<wait><page>
But giving this to an old-timer like me doesn't do anyone
any good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3514]
I admit you've lost me with this one. What am I supposed
to do with it, exactly?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3515]
Oh ho! Did you come to show me that? I hope Mei grows
up to be as kind as you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3516]
Foxes are terrifying creatures.
What will you do if one ensnares you in some wily trap?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3517]
Ho ho, how beautiful. Maybe I'll give it to Mei when she
grows up. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3518]
Ho ho! This would make a fine present for Mei when she
grows up. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3519]
Ho ho! What a pleasant fragrance.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3520]
Oh? Is this for me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3521]
Ah, that's right! Let me teach you how to make
Ice Cream.<wait><page>
Mei pestered me into learning how to make it.
Remember what I'm about to tell you, hm?<wait><page>
You'll need Milk, an Egg, and a Seasoning Set.
As for cookware, you'll need a Whisk and a Pot.<wait><page>
We all scream for ice cream, as they say. Ho ho.
You should try making some yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3522]
Oh ho, a Blue Feather. About to propose to someone,
I take it? Good luck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3523]
Hello, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3524]
Do you know a place called Forgotten Valley?<wait><page>
Apparently, there's a farmer there who really knows
their way around a stable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3525]
There's a tortoise in Forgotten Valley that used to be
owned by a comic artist long ago, apparently.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3526]
On Mondays, I like to visit the mayor at his house.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3527]
Today's when I take my usual trip to the Hot Spring.
I'm glad it's sunny out.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3528]
I feel much better now. A soak in the Hot Spring really
soothes both body and soul.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3529]
I WAS going to visit the Hot Spring today, but the
weather says otherwise. It's quite unfortunate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3530]
What are you doing around here?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3531]
It's just me and my little granddaughter here.
Nothing of interest for you, I'm sure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3532]
Every morning, I check to see how the animals are doing.
Things can get out of hand quickly if you forget about
them.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3533]
Dogs truly are man's best friend.
They get smarter the more you play fetch with them,
you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3534]
How are things at your place? Did you get your cows and
chickens inside?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3535]
Be careful not to catch a cold yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3536]
Oh? Did you come to visit?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3537]
Come see us again sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3538]
Is your farm developing nicely? It will no doubt be an
undertaking to get it looking like it once did. Good luck.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3539]
Something tells me you can do just about anything if you
put your mind to it, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3540]
Being a mayor sounds very, very difficult.
Politics and administration are two things
I could never handle.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3541]
Speaking of which, Thomas's father was a mayor, too.
I wonder if Harris will follow in his footsteps someday.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3542]
I wonder how Saibara and Ellen are holding up?
Maybe we should all get together sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3543]
<playername>, life is short. You should make as many
friends as you can.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3544]
Oh, is everything all right?
Are you considering a dip in the Hot Spring as well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3545]
Mei doesn't seem to like getting in hot water.
Literally, I mean. She always waits for me outside.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3546]
Phew, nothing like a long soak to ease the aches and pains
of these old bones.<wait><page>
It's such a luxury to have a Hot Spring right around the
corner from home!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3547]
You know, if I wasn't so lucky to have a Hot Spring
at my disposal...<wait><page>
...I might have had to retire from farming by now.
I'm really grateful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3548]
Kids these days stay up way too late.
I have a hard time putting Mei to bed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3549]
I think I'm going to head to bed soon myself.
See you tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3550]
Are you taking good care of your animals?
They're the best judge of character around,
you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3551]
<playername>. If you have some free time, could you
play with Mei?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3552]
I talk to the animals every day. Developing trust with
your livestock is an essential part of being a farmer.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3553]
I wonder how Ellen's doing? I'm sure she'd be pleased to
receive a visit from you, <playername>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3554]
Old as I am, the thrill of betting at the Derby still hasn't
lost its luster. Speaking of, I've still got to place this
season's wager!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3555]
The horses at this season's Derby are all quite splendid!
Do you have any particular favorites?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3556]
Only the strongest chickens can win the Cluck-Cluck
Clash. If you ask me, it takes teamwork from both bird
and owner to take the prize.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3557]
Now, the question is, which chicken will take home the
prize this year...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3558]
I've been so busy with preparations for the Moo-Moo
Festival, that I haven't even checked to see whose cows
are entering yet!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3559]
Oof, these old bones are aching from all these festival
preparations... But I know it'll all be worth it tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3560]
Old as I am, the thrill of betting at the Derby still hasn't
lost its luster. Speaking of, I've still got to place this
season's wager!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3561]
The horses at this season's Derby are all quite splendid!
Do you have any particular favorites?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3562]
We celebrate several types of animals at the Fluffy
Festival, so we should have a diverse lineup of critters
competing!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3563]
We're holding the Fluffy Festival tomorrow. I hope you'll
enjoy it as much as I do!<wait>

I am Bon Vivant, a food critic of some small renown and
an aficionado of all things gastronomical. A pleasure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3620]
A birthday present for me?
How appetizingly altruistic of you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3621]
Mmm! What a delectably delicious-looking dish. In my
mind, I have already begun to savor it. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3622]
Ah, a most eminently edible offering.
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3623]
I sense sensational culinary potential in this!
You have my thanks.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3624]
A...Failed Dish? Oh, what heartache!
What sacrifice! You must endeavor to respect your
ingredients more!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3625]
I have no need of medicine, thank you.
I am perfectly healthy.
You may take it away now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3626]
I live life by a simple maxim: if I cannot eat it, it is useless
to me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3627]
Aha. An offering of chocolates for Valentine's Day,
I presume? Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3628]
Thank you. I will enjoy this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3629]
My, my! This should be discussed away from prying eyes.
Let us retire to the privacy of your abode.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3630]
Now, to what end have you shown such a scrumptiously
symbolic token to me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3631]
Do you, a culinary neophyte who has yet to master
the art of cookery, truly believe yourself worthy of
marrying me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3632]
Do you, a culinary charlatan who has yet to win a
Cooking Exhibition, truly believe yourself worthy of
marrying me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3633]
Do you, a fledgling chef who has won but a handful of
Cooking Exhibitions, truly believe yourself worthy of
marrying me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3634]
I shall return again next year with my palate primed for
a most piquant feast.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3635]
We have few gentleman entrants again this year.
The wide world of cuisine is for all people,
regardless of gender.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3636]
Tomorrow is Starlight Night.
Please return home no later than 6:00 PM.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3637]
Goodness, what a surprise to learn that you are
pregnant.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3638]
To think that one day soon, I will be head chef to a little
sous of our own.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3639]
Just as the finest flavors develop with time, so too must
our little one ripen before coming into this world.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3640]
Please ensure that you stick to a balanced and healthy
diet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3641]
I believe our young one will be making their debut on the
world stage any day now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3642]
Whether boy or girl, I'm sure he or she will be a deft
hand in the kitchen.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3643]
I have been told that our young one will be born
tomorrow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3644]
I suggest you retire early today so as to be ready for the
big day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3645]
Good morning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3646]
I want to provide a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle for our
young <childname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3647]
Good morning.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3648]
Little by little, our <childname> is getting bigger
and bigger.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3649]
Children grow so very quickly.
I'm reminded of a rising mound of my favorite
bread dough.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3650]
I think little <childname> is learning how to stand.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3651]
You are not allowing <childname> to have too many
sugary snacks, are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3652]
Oh, look.
<childname> has learned how to walk.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3653]
<childname> has grown so much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3654]
When <childname> is sufficiently grown, I will pass
down all of my superlative culinary skills and knowledge.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3655]
I'm afraid my affection for you is still rather low.
Lower than level three, even.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3656]
If you'll recall, I said that my affection for you is
presently lower than level three.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3657]
The mild aroma of affection tickles my nose. I'd put my
interest in you around level four.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3658]
If you'll recall, I said that my affection for you is about
level four.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3659]
I'm growing something of a craving for your company.
About a level-five craving, I'd say.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3660]
If you'll recall, I said that my affection for you is about
level five.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3661]
You're beginning to be a flavor I cannot live without.
I would say my affection for you is at least level six.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3662]
If you'll recall, I said that my affection for you is about
level six.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3663]
You are as ambrosia to my palate.
The way I feel about you has exceeded my love for any
culinary delicacy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3664]
If you'll recall, I said that I hold maximum affection for
you now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3665]
Oh. Hello, <playername>.
What brings you to me today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3666]
The energies that radiate from this mountain do much
to soothe my soul.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3667]
The twittering of the birds...
The gentle babbling of the brook...
The whisper of the wind...<wait><page>
When I visit the mountain in solitude, nature speaks,
and I am obliged to listen. Is that not wondrous?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3668]
Sometimes, when I am alone in my tent, I will sense a
presence altogether alien to this plane.<wait><page>
Its energy is on a different wavelength from humans and
animals. I am convinced that it must be a mountain spirit.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3669]
Oh. Hello, <playername>.
Basking in nature's splendor today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3670]
I know that your farm duties must keep you quite busy,
but it is important to shift your paradigm on occasion.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3671]
Do you raise crops on your farm? Some farmers choose
to utilize fertilizer and chemicals to raise quality
vegetables.<wait><page>
Personally, I believe it best to let the vegetables grow
naturally, with little interference from human hands.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3672]
The fertilizers I've seen used in this town are all-natural,
so I am not especially worried about their use.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3673]
I sometimes see Mr. Gotts up on the mountain.
Looking at him reminds me of how harsh a mistress
Mother Nature is.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3674]
<playername>, you go up the mountain to cut trees
from time to time, correct?<wait><page>
You cannot be faulted for taking only as much as you
need, but please remember to respect the spirits you
are uprooting.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3675]
The lovely people of this town know how to make
excellent conversation. They hold a real reverence for
Mother Nature.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3676]
This town is wonderfully free, everyone living orderly
lives in harmony with one another. I find it fantabulous.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3677]
I have always seen you as someone who understands me
for who I am, <playername>.<wait><page>
And I think I'm coming to understand in turn what
farming truly means to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3678]
Whether man or woman, young or old, you or me, we all
live by the grace of Mother Nature's bounteous gifts.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3679]
Oh. Hello, <playername>.
How have you been?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3680]
How is your husband?
Are your energies in sync?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3681]
How is your wife?
Are your energies in sync?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3682]
You seem to be enjoying life even more than ever. I guess
there is merit to the saying "two is better than one."<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3683]
<playername>, you strike me as the type to treat
your husband well. The vibes I sense from your aura
tell me so.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3684]
<playername>, you strike me as the type to treat
your wife well. The vibes I sense from your aura
tell me so.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3685]
Remember, <playername>: you are no longer alone.
Be mindful of your health, for the sake of your partner.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3686]
Spending time with your husband is good, but you must
also make time to visit Mother Nature and absorb Her
energies.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3687]
Spending time with your wife is good, but you must also
make time to visit Mother Nature and absorb Her
energies.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3688]
Are you getting along well with your spouse?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3689]
<playername>, you strike me as the type to treat
your spouse well. The vibes I sense from your aura
tell me so.<wait>

energies.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3692]
Oh. Hello, <playername>.
How have you been?<wait><page>
Come to think of it, I don't believe I've learned your child's
name yet.<wait><page>
<childname>, is it? Lovely. Your family, blessed as it
is by Mother Nature, will no doubt foster a healthy child.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3693]
I am excited to watch <childname> grow into
a person that reflects your values.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3694]
I wonder what it feels like to build a new family
for oneself...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3695]
My heart would be full if I could give all children the
chance to grow at their own pace in Mother Nature's
embrace.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3696]
<playername>, your countenance has taken on a new
dimension since the birth of your child.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3697]
I wonder, are humans meant to live together as family?
I can't help but think that's what Mother Nature intends.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3698]
I cannot for the life of me understand Mr. Carter, the
priest. What a vexing man. What is it he believes in?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3699]
Everyone in this town is a truly wondiferous person.
I will admit that some of them are...unique, though.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3700]
I visited the Vineyard the other day and chatted with
Manna. I think the sun went down before she stopped to
breathe once.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3701]
Socialization is a crucial part of the human experience.
We are part of the natural cycle too, after all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3702]
Hello there, <playername>.
How are the energies of your farm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3703]
I spend nights at the Inn. Dudley is a most considerate
host, and his daughter Ran is a sweet girl.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3704]
The ocean is so soothing. Mother Nature plays a most
beautiferous and soothing melody by way of Her ocean
waves.<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3705]
Strolling along the beach, I often discover lovely
gemstones called sea glass embedded in the sand.<wait><page>
They are bits of glass weathered by the waves for
decades, eventually becoming smooth, frosted pebbles.<wait><page>
I find them quite marvelous.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3706]
Oh. Hello. Are you a resident here?
I don't believe I've heard your name.<wait><page>
Ah. <playername>, is it?
I'm Jennifer. A pleasure.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3707]
Oh! Simply marvelful! Wondiferous!
My most gracious gratitude to you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3708]
Oh, thank you! My stars must be in alignment for me to
receive a gift this lovely today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3709]
Oh, is this for me?
Thank you! You know me well.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3710]
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3711]
This is for me? Well... In gift-giving, it IS the thought
that counts...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3712]
I really wish you wouldn't have put me in this position.
If you really insist, I suppose I'll take it. Hm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3713]
Stars above, earth below!
You remembered my birthday!
Why, thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3714]
My, my! What an adorable little face.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3715]
I am aware of their role in Mother Nature's cycle...
But I still can't tolerate them. I'm sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3716]
I generally prefer not to adorn myself with trinkets,
but since you are offering it as a gift... Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3717]
I personally have no need of such things, but perhaps I can
gift it to someone else.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3718]
A present for my birthday? So you remembered! I cannot
say no to anything you offer. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3719]
I personally have no need of such things, but perhaps I can
gift it to someone else.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3720]
A...Blue Feather? If I'm not mistaken, isn't that a token to
symbolize a marriage proposal?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3721]
Hm? My, you look awfully serious today.
Tell me what's going on.<wait><page>
Aha. Yes. I believe we have something we must discuss.
Let's go to your house for some privacy, shall we?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3722]
Oh, a Preserved Flower. Ah, an interesting item indeed.
Why are you showing it to me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3723]
Wait, is that...?<wait><page>
Perhaps we should go somewhere private to discuss this.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3724]
I think it is much too early for us to be considering such
a big step.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3725]
I...need a little more time before I can give serious
thought to that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3726]
Oh, are these cookies for me?
Why, thank you! I admit I have something
of a sweet tooth.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3727]
Oh, are these cookies for me?
Aah, I see. A return gift for Valentine's Day. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3728]
Oh, are these cookies for me?
Why, thank you!<wait><page>
I hope you will anticipate Valentine's Day this year. I will
definitely give you a return gift...if I remember.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3729]
That's right, today is the town holiday of White Day,
isn't it?<wait><page>
Hee hee. Well, now's as good a time as any to share
gifts with those we love, don't you think?<wait><page>
Thank you ever so much! ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3730]
Isn't today the town holiday of Valentine's Day?
I could have sworn it was.<wait><page>
Are you certain you want to give these to me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3731]
Isn't today the town holiday of Valentine's Day?
I could have sworn it was.<wait><page>
Well, as long as you are offering, then I will gratefully
accept. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3732]
<playername>, you do know that tomorrow is
Starlight Night, yes?<wait><page>
If you'd like, you're welcome to join me in watching
the stars.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3733]
Excellent. I will await your arrival.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3734]
Oh? I see. I will simply enjoy the soothing energies of the
night sky on my own, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3735]
Good morning.
And what a pleasant morning it is.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3736]
Give your best effort to your farm today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3737]
The secret to good health is to eat natural foods in their
most natural form.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3738]
The mountains around this town are rife with the bounty
of Mother Nature.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3739]
To rise and sleep with the sun--Mother Nature,
celestial baton in hand, conducts our circadian
rhythm thus.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3740]
<nickname>, you are tired. I can tell.
You ought to rest early tonight.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3741]
Good morning, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3742]
The morning hours exude a renewing energy that helps us
face every day as it comes. Now, what to do today?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3743]
Life on a farm is certainly one of toil, but it provides a
wealth of natural luxury in the form of food and drink.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3744]
It is of course important to see to what needs doing, but
let's both remember to stop and smell the roses, hm?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3745]
Today was a long and exhausting--but fulfilling--day.
Now for some well-deserved rest. ∀<wait>

Everyone, from time to time, should turn their gaze
upward at night and bathe in the stars' soft energy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3748]
Good morning, <nickname>. ∀
Did you sleep well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3749]
Good morning, <nickname>. ∀
Did you sleep well?<wait>

There is something invigorating about waking up each

[3752]
Are you being sure to rest when you feel tired?
Overworking will throw your body's natural rhythm
off balance.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3753]
To live by the land, reaping its bounty firsthand, dancing
to nature's rhythm... Doesn't it make you feel truly alive?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3754]
The sun has gone to bed for the night, and we should
follow its lead. ∀<wait>

<------------------------------------------------------->
[3756]
The peaceful serenity we enjoy here makes it easy to fall
into a deep and restorative sleep.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3757]
The sea breeze feels a little like the breath of Mother
Nature Herself tickling your cheek, don't you think?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3758]
It's a good omen when I find sea glass on my strolls along
the beach. Its natural energy serves to amplify my own.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3759]
Hm? Where are you going, <nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3760]
Farm work is very tiring, I'm sure.
I recommend you take the occasional walk to relax
and recharge.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3761]
Even now that we're married, you do nothing to
constrain or bind me. That is part of why I love you,
<nickname>. ∀<wait>

We love and respect one another's lifestyles the way we
revere our own. That is a precious, important thing.<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3764]
I wouldn't mind going out on the occasional date with you,

anyway. Perhaps I might think to try it in the future.<wait>

Ah, that's right. Today is White Day, isn't it? How sweet
of you to give me this even now that we're married. ∀<wait>

What do you want?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3791]
If you have no business with me, leave.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3792]
Ah. <playername>.
I am occupied at the moment.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3793]
Even if I am not busy with a physical task, I assure you
that my mind is hard at work conceiving new ideas.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3794]
Now, sit and watch me.<wait><page>
You sense something, yes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3795]
To view an object is not simply to observe its facade,
it is to bear witness to its truth with your mind.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3796]
Do you find some enjoyment in speaking with me?<wait><page>
Most people avoid speaking with me as much as possible.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3797]
Expressing myself with words is not my forte. If you wish
to know me better, I urge you to look at my art.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3798]
I have little finesse in idle chit-chat, but make yourself
at home.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3799]
It is odd, but when you are here with me,
<playername>, I feel as if my imagination soars to
greater heights.<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3800]
Ah. <playername>. If you'll permit me to say
something rather straightforward...<wait><page>
You have an attractive face. It is an aesthetically
faithful recreation of your inner beauty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3801]
Quiet, please. I wish to observe your face
in greater detail.<wait><page>
The tingle of inspiration tickles at the periphery
of my mind.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3802]
When you view an object with your eyes, at first it is
simply a collection of shapes and lines.<wait><page>
As you dig beneath that facade and discover its true
form within, your path to expressing that form becomes
clear.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3803]
"An image is worth a thousand words." To fully
comprehend that phrase, you must still your tongue
and use your eyes.<wait><page>
See the work. FEEL it.
Feel it with your body and your soul.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3804]
Almost...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3805]
Even in marriage, I think we both should still pursue our
chosen endeavors freely, helping each other as needed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3806]
I hear you got married.
Are things going well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3807]
I am as I have always been.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3808]
Ah. <playername>. How is married life?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3809]
I may need to go in search of new inspiration soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3810]
I hear you had a child.
Being a parent must be laborious indeed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3811]
Building and caring for a family are prospects far
beyond my meager artistic talents.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3812]
You seem well. I guess it is true what people say about
parenthood being a transformative force.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3813]
Children are geniuses. They see things for what they are,
and can express themselves with enviable clarity.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3814]
Hello.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3815]
What is it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3816]
What business have you with me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3817]
I will occasionally stroll through this locale, searching for
inspiration and materials alike.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3818]
The imagination is a critical tool for artists.
I nurture and grow mine through interaction
both social and natural.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3819]
Speaking with you is refreshing, <playername>.
You ignite my imagination.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3820]
Hm? And you are?<wait><page>
<playername>? I see.
I am Brandon. The pleasure's mine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3821]
Thank you. This seems useful.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3822]
Thank you, <playername>. I'm surprised you are
aware of my preferences.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3823]
For me? Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3824]
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3825]
...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3826]
What is this? I have no need of it.
Take it away, would you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3827]
Ah. Thank you. Come to think of it, today is my birthday,
isn't it? I'd utterly forgotten.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3828]
Yes. Quite cute.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3829]
That does not interest me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3830]
I appreciate all things beautiful on principle...
Do you think this suits me?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3831]
I have little interest in such things, but if you are giving it
to me, I will accept it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3832]
Mm. A nice scent.
You have surprisingly refined taste.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3833]
What is it, <playername>? A Preserved Flower?<wait><page>
...No. I can guess. We cannot speak privately here.
Let us abscond to your house.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3834]
It has come to my attention that this is the object
presented during the act of confessing one's romantic
interest.<wait><page>
Ah. If you are presenting it to me, I am sorry.
I am uninterested in such things.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3835]
Ah...! That is...!<wait><page>
Let us go somewhere we can discuss this in private.
Your house seems wise.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3836]
I think it is still too soon for us. There is no hurry.
Let's take our time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3837]
It would please me to visit Forgotten Valley sometime.
Have you heard of it?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3838]
Thank you. I enjoy sweet foods.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3839]
Thank you. I enjoy sweet foods.<wait><page>
Hm? A return present for last White Day? Ah. I must say,
though, there was no particularly deep meaning in that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3840]
Thank you. I enjoy sweet foods.<wait><page>
Hm? A return present for last White Day? Ah.
I'd entirely forgotten about this ritual.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3841]
Valentine's Day? Ah. No wonder.<wait><page>
No, no. If you are certain you wish to give this to me,
I will gladly accept. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3842]
Valentine's Day? Ah. No wonder.<wait><page>
So it is still acceptable to give and receive these even
after entering into a relationship. I like that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3843]
Sources suggest that the night sky will be particularly
lovely tomorrow. Would you care to join me in stargazing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3844]
Ah. Excellent. Come no later than 6:00 PM, then.
I will be waiting.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3845]
Ah. A pity.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3846]
Mm. Good morning.
My head is still in something of a fog.<wait>

[3847]
Living on a farm means rising far earlier than I am
accustomed to. I will need time to acclimate.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3848]
It is odd. Simply being here somehow compels me to take
the day at a more relaxed pace.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3849]
Farm work keeps one quite busy, I see.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3850]
I suggest making restful sleep a priority. You exert
yourself quite a bit in the course of your daily chores.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3851]
Darkness brings with it its own inspirations. This town is
quiet enough to allow them the space to grow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3852]
Good morning, <nickname>. The morning hours on a
farm are quite pleasant, I find.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3853]
Recently, I've found my creative spirit fully engaged,
even in the early morning hours.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3854]
If you are tired, take a break.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3855]
There are so many fascinating things to observe here
that I don't foresee myself growing bored any time soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3856]
Why not retire for the night?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3857]
Pay me no heed.
If you wish to retire, please go ahead.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3858]
Good morning, <nickname>. I have been here long
enough that I feel in tune with the earth's natural
rhythms.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3859]
It occurs to me that all the time I have spent with you
has marked a shift in my artistic style,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3860]
It's odd, really. I could not tell you how, but marriage has
changed my worldview somehow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3861]
It's odd, really. I could not tell you how, but marriage has
changed my worldview somehow.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3862]
<nickname>, I am beginning to feel your presence
in my creative process. I think this piece may be one
of my best.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3863]
Is the farm doing well? I do not recommend overexerting
yourself.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3864]
<nickname>, I think your presence has become an
integral part of my creation process. You are my muse.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3865]
Ah. Hello, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3866]
Do not disturb me, please.
I am attempting to brainstorm.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3867]
Hello, <nickname>.
Is something the matter?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3868]
If you have no business with me, please do not disturb my
thought process.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3869]
Where are you going?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3870]
This is no idle stroll. When I take my walks, I find varied
inspiration in what I observe.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3871]
The seeds of creation bud in nature and the natural
order of things. I like to observe what my eye catches
keenly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3872]
There are a vast multitude of things in this town that
spur my imagination.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3873]
It seems everyone likes you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3874]
You know, I think my works have become brighter and
more optimistic since I married you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3875]
You know, I think my works have become brighter and
more optimistic since I married you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3876]
Right now, inside your body, resides a new, budding life.
What a strange and wondrous thing to ponder.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3877]
Creating new life... Nature is as powerful as it is
magnificent.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3878]
I can see your belly is starting to protrude somewhat.
Are you all right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3879]
Your body and health are important.
Take care of them both.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3880]
Are you feeling all right? You seem to have become
somewhat sedentary. Perhaps a little exercise would do
you good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3881]
I think I'd like to create something based on the image of
you as you are now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3882]
I believe our child will soon be born. Are you prepared?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3883]
At a time like this, there is little I can do.
It is all in your hands.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3884]
I can still hardly believe that I have a child now.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3885]
Family... It still does not feel real.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3886]
<childname> is growing.
From my perspective, at least.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3887]
Watching <childname> is so amusing.
I don't think I'll ever get bored.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3888]
Children are geniuses. Their imagination paints the world
with colors I could only dream of.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3889]
I wonder what <childname> is thinking.<wait><page>
How fascinating it would be to take a peek within the
mind of a child.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3890]
<childname> has begun acting more like a real child
and less like a noisy flesh-bean.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3891]
Do you think <childname> resembles me in
appearance?<wait><page>
No. Our child's facial features are definitely much more
reminiscent of yours, <nickname>.
Don't you agree?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3892]
It's odd. I can't shake the feeling that <childname>
is starting to resemble me.<wait><page>
Wait...no. I think the resemblance stems from you more
than me. Don't you agree?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3893]
It is startling how quickly children grow.
We, too, are growing older in turn...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3894]
I wonder what sort of art <childname>
will create?<wait><page>
Whatever it is, I'm sure it will be magnificent.
I would expect no less of our child.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3895]
Does your stomach trouble you?
Do not stress yourself overmuch.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3896]
I will soon be a father.
...I hope I don't mess it up too badly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3897]
Is <childname> well?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3898]
I'd like to take <childname> for a stroll sometime.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3899]
Aah, thank you! I am always happy to receive gifts
like these.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3900]
Aah, thank you, <nickname>!
I knew I could trust my wife to remember my
preferences.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3901]
Aah, thank you, <nickname>!
I knew I could trust my husband to remember my
preferences.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3902]
A thoughtful present. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3903]
Thank you, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3904]
...You DO know my preferences, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3905]
Why are you giving this to me? You ought to know what
gives me joy and what gives me pause.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3906]
Ah, thank...you?<wait><page>
Oh. Today is my birthday, isn't it?
At least one of us remembered. Haha.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3907]
You aren't suggesting we keep it, are you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3908]
I enjoy beauty in all forms simply on principle, but I think
this may suit you better than me, <nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3909]
I am not generally interested in these things, but if you
are giving it to me, I will accept it.<wait><page>
Do you not feel a little odd about gifting such things to
your husband, though?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3910]
I am not generally interested in these things, but if you
are giving it to me, I will accept it.<wait><page>
Do you not feel a little odd about gifting such things to
your husband, though?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3911]
A-Ah! Is that...?!<wait><page>
We must speak in private.
Let us abscond to your house.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3912]
A-Ah! Is that...?!<wait><page>
I see. I am grateful you feel that way, but I...I do not.
Not yet, at least. I'm sorry.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3913]
Someday, I would like to visit Forgotten Valley.
We could make a trip of it, you and I.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3914]
Ah, sweets? Thank you. You know me all too well.<wait><page>
We are married now. You really needn't worry about
that, you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3915]
Thank you. I enjoy sweet foods.<wait><page>
Hm? A return present for last White Day? We are
married now. You really needn't worry about that,
you know.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3916]
For Valentine's Day?<wait><page>
Ah. So it is tradition to continue giving such things even
after marriage? I've learned something today. Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3917]
For Valentine's Day?<wait><page>
Ah. So it is tradition to continue giving such things even

Whatever it is, I'm sure it will be magnificent.
I would expect no less of our child.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3919]
Ah, the Fireworks Festival is tomorrow, is it not?
It should prove to be a great source of inspiration
for my work.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3920]
Tomorrow evening will be a full moon. Why, I might just
transform! ...I was kidding. You needn't look so concerned.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3921]
<nickname>, thank you!
I knew I married you for good reason. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3922]
Good morning, <nickname>. ∀<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3923]
It feels...odd. But that odd feeling is a sign
that Mother Nature has taken Her course.
I now hold new life within me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3924]
I am fine. This is all a perfectly natural process.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3925]
I have been so hungry lately. SO hungry. I have to eat
more, both for myself and for the baby I'm carrying.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3926]
Just so that you are aware, I am not fat. I'm pregnant.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3927]
My belly keeps getting bigger and bigger. I wonder what
our child will be like.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3928]
Will it be a boy? A girl? Who will they resemble?
I can hardly wait to find out. Don't you agree,
<nickname>?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3929]
Oof... Mmh... I think the baby's arrival is probably
imminent, given these...kicks...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3930]
<nickname>! You do your best too!
We will both excel--together!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3931]
Babies are splendiferously cute, aren't they?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3932]
<childname> is the cutest baby in the whole
world--though I suppose that's obvious,
being OUR baby and all.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3933]
Children grow so quickly.
It's as if they get bigger by the hour.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3934]
My heart would be full if I could give our child a leisurely
upbringing surrounded by Mother Nature's embrace.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3935]
You know, I think <childname> may be starting
to speak.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3936]
I cannot say how, but I think I understand what
<childname> is saying.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3937]
<childname> is getting big enough to walk. Before
too long, we will be able to go for family strolls together.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3938]
You, me, and <childname>. All three of us can go for
a walk up the mountain and discover Mother Nature's
beauty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3939]
<childname> is growing up to be a healthy and
happy child. We are truly blessed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3940]
I left my home and abandoned my old family, but now I'm
starting to see the merits of a family who loves you.<wait><page>
Perhaps I will go back there one day to visit Mother and
Father.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3941]
Getting exercise is good for my health and the baby both.
The same goes for basking in the energy of Mother
Nature.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3942]
Did you know babies can hear when they are in the
womb? Natural sounds can be especially nurturing
and pacifying.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3943]
Oh, hello, <nickname>.
How is <childname> doing?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3944]
Every now and again, I need to get out and immerse
myself in Mother Nature's energies. And breathe in
Her air.<wait><page>
I hope to bring <childname> along with me
sometime soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3945]
I wonder what sort of person <childname> will
grow up to be.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3946]
I want to give <childname> a leisurely upbringing
spent learning and growing in the embrace of
Mother Nature.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3947]
I have always seen you as someone who understands me
for who I am, <playername>.<wait><page>
Of course, I like to believe that I understand you for who
you are, too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3948]
Whether man or woman, young or old, you or me, we all
live by the grace of Mother Nature's bounteous gifts.<wait><page>
The two of us living together as one is surely what She
wished of us.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3949]
Fireworks are such whimsical things: burning as bright as
a star only to disappear in a flash...! I look forward to
tomorrow night's festivities.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3950]
Mother Nature is kind to share Her lunar powers with
us, after Her long journey to the summit. We mustn't
take these cosmic gifts for granted.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3951]
Oh, dear. I'm afraid I really don't care for this at all,
sweetheart.<wait><page>
Don't worry. I'm sure you just didn't know. It's all right.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3952]
Gah! I really can't stand that...<wait><page>
What, is this news to you? Ah, that's okay then.
Can't blame you for not knowing.<wait> 
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3953]
Eeew! I really don't like that!
...What, you didn't know? Oh. Well, then I forgive you.
Just don't do it again!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3954]
Erm! I'm sorry, but, er...
I really do not like that...<wait><page>
No, no. If no one told you, you wouldn't know. It's all right.
Everyone makes mistakes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3955]
Yuck! I don't like those! Not one bit! Oh, you didn't know? I
guess that's okay. You didn't know better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3956]
Urk...! You want me to take that?
Can't say it does anything for me...<wait><page>
Ah well. It's not as if you knew I would react that way.
It's fine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3957]
Oh, uh, sorry. I'm really not into that... Ah, you didn't
know? Gotcha. Not much for it, then. No worries.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3958]
O-Oh, uh... Sorry. I don't like this kinda stuff.
What, you didn't know? Ah. That's okay, then.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3959]
Oh dear. That? I don't like that at all. Still, if you didn't
know, you didn't know. Just please don't do it again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3960]
Ah, I'm afraid I'm rather unfond of those. Hm?
You're surprised to find out there's something
I dislike?<wait><page>
Hahaha. I'm human just like everyone else, you know.
We all have preferences.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3961]
Oh, this is... Erm... Well, to be blunt, I'm not fond of this
at all.<wait><page>
Oh, you didn't know? Goodness, did I not tell you?
Well, no wonder, then. It's all right. You didn't know
better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3962]
Goodness, that's worse than a papercut. But I never told
you I didn't like those, did I? You had no way of knowing.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3963]
Oof! I, ah, am rather terribly unfond of these...
Oh, you didn't know? Aaah. That's all right, then.<wait><page>
I am the mayor, yes, but I am also a person, too.
I have my likes and dislikes, like anyone else.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3964]
...Erm, I'm afraid this isn't really something
I'm comfortable with. I didn't tell you, so you couldn't
have known.<wait><page>
Still, as someone who tries to be a role model for others,
I'm embarrassed to admit there are things I dislike.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3965]
My, my... I don't like these, dear.<wait><page>
Aah, you didn't know? There's no point in making you feel
bad about it, then. You just didn't know better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3966]
Goodness, did Yu put you up to this?
...Oh, wait. You wouldn't know I dislike these, would you?<wait><page>
It's fine. I can't blame you for not knowing better.
Assuming you're being honest with me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3967]
Gah! You're copying me?!
But I hate these things!<wait><page>
Though I guess if you just didn't know... Ugh, now I'm
starting to get how everyone feels when I mess with 'em.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3968]
Oh, uh, yay...? Thank youuuaaARGH.
Nope. I can't do it. I'm sorry, but I can't stand these.<wait><page>
Still, you couldn't have known better. 
I never said anything about it to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3969]
Ah, sorry. I'm pretty bothered by those. Oh, you didn't
know? Well, I guess it's all right, then.<wait><page>
But let this be a lesson, okay?
Please don't do this again.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3970]
I like this about as much as I like an empty bottle. Which
is to say...I don't. But it's okay. We all make mistakes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3971]
...I'm afraid I don't like these at all.<wait><page>
No, no. You wouldn't have known unless I told you.
It's all right. I know you didn't mean anything by it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3972]
Heavens... Folks say I have saintly patience, but even
I have a few things that rub me the wrong way.<wait><page>
Well, all right. A lot of things.
But I forgive you, my child. You simply did not know
better this time.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3973]
Um, I don't like these. I tend to keep that kind of stuff
to myself, so you wouldn't have known. It's okay.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3974]
Urf! Wow, uh... Sorry, but I don't like this much at all.<wait><page>
Still, you wouldn't have known that, would you? It's okay,
it's okay. I know you didn't mean anything by it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3975]
The heck?! Um, sorry, but that's almost worse than
a dirty floor to me...<wait><page>
Oh well! It's not like you could've known, huh? Ha ha ha.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3976]
I, uh, hate this almost as much as I hate winter. But you
couldn'ta known, so I guess it's not really your fault.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3977]
Ah, this crap? Sorry. I ain't too fond of it. Still, I doubt
you knew, so I guess I'll give ya a mulligan.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3978]
...I dislike those to the extreme. I rarely mention that to
others, though, so I guess you would not have known.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3979]
I find this astonishingly awful. Though... You wouldn't have
known, as I did not tell you. I guess it's okay.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3980]
Oh, uh...yeah. Sorry. I don't like these one bit. Ah well.
You couldn'ta known, right? Don't worry 'bout it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3981]
Those? No. Worse than an empty wallet, yes? But you did
not know, so you cannot help it. All is forgiven.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3982]
My, my! How unappetizing. But you did not know my
tastes skewed away from this. No reason to fret over it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3983]
Oh, hi, <playername>. ...Oh, goodness, nooo. I don't like
these at all, silly.<wait><page>
It's the first time you've made this mistake, so you
wouldn't know. Don't worry about it, don't worry
about it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3984]
Ick. I no like these at all... Oh well. First time, mistake.
Is okay.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3985]
Erm, I'm afraid I must admit I do not care for those in
the slightest. But you did not know better.
Understandable.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3986]
Ah, you wanna give me that? Yikes.
Can't say I feel much obliged.<wait><page>
Ah well. Nobody knows what they ain't been told yet.
A mistake's a mistake, and that's okay.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3987]
Um, I'm sorry.
I don't like these at all.<wait><page>
But no one knows the first time. It's okay.
You just didn't know better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3988]
Um, I'm sorry.
I don't like these at all.<wait><page>
But no one knows the first time. It's okay.
You just didn't know better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3989]
Um, I'm sorry.
I don't like these at all.<wait><page>
But no one knows the first time. It's okay.
You just didn't know better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3990]
Um, I'm sorry.
I don't like these at all.<wait><page>
But no one knows the first time. It's okay.
You just didn't know better.<wait>

Um, I'm sorry.
I don't like these at all.<wait><page>
But no one knows the first time. It's okay.
You just didn't know better.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3994]
Hm? Dear, you've already been kind enough to give me
a present today. I couldn't ask for another one already.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3995]
Thanks, but you already gave me a present today.
I'd feel guilty taking another one from you so soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3996]
Thanks, but that's okay! You already gave me a present
today, silly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3997]
Oh, no, no. I couldn't. You were already kind enough to give
me a present earlier today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3998]
Huh? You already gave me a present today.
I like presents, but I don't want to be greedy.
Being greedy is selfish.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[3999]
Hold your horses, there. You already gave me a gift today.
One is more than enough for an old man like me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4000]
Nah, that's okay. You already got me something today,
so I'm good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4001]
What, another present? Naaah. Thanks for the thought,
but you don't have to do that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4002]
Oh my, another present? I couldn't. You were already kind
enough to give me one earlier.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4003]
My, my! You already gave me a gift today, though,
so I think I will accept just the thought this time.
Thank you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4004]
Goodness, another one? You already gave me a gift today.
I couldn't ask you for another one so soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4005]
Goodness, but you already gave me a present today.
One is more than enough for me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4006]
Hrm? But you already gave me a gift today. I couldn't
possibly bother you for another one so soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4007]
Hm? You're a model citizen, trying to give me a second
present today. I will gladly accept the thought, however.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4008]
Oh dear, I couldn't. Not when you've already given
me a present today. But thank you for the thought,
sweetheart.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4009]
Hm? But you already gave me a present today.
I hardly deserve another one.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4010]
Ooh, wow! You're gonna give me another present today?
Man, you sure are super generous! Heck yeah!<wait><page>
Oh, but I can totally see my sister thinkin' I tricked you
into it. Um...maybe gimme it later, then?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4011]
Oh, no, I couldn't. Not when you already gave me
something today. Really. Just the thought is more than
enough for me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4012]
My! <playername>, didn't you already give me
a present earlier today? Two is too much.
Just the thought is enough.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4013]
Huh? But didn't you already give me something today?
Just one is plenty for me, thanks. No need to suck up.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4014]
Hm? Ah, thank you, truly, but you already gave a present
to me today. It would be unbecoming to ask for more.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4015]
Oh my Goddess! For me? Thank you for the generous
thought, but you already gave a gift to me today.
One is plenty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4016]
You already gave me something today.
I couldn't ask for more.
I'm not sure I earned it anyway.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4017]
What, another present? Thanks for the thought,
but I couldn't possibly.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4018]
Huh? You already gave me something today.
One is enough for me. But thanks!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4019]
Huh? Wait, I thought you already gave me somethin'
today. That's plenty, trust. I couldn't ask for more.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4020]
You already got me somethin' today. Takin' another
would be just plain greedy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4021]
You already gave me a gift today.
I wouldn't want to be boorish.
One is plenty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4022]
Hm? You have already given me a gift today. The thought
is more than enough. Mother Nature bless you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4023]
Whoa, didn't you already give me somethin' today?
I'd feel too guilty if I took somethin' ELSE from ya.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4024]
You want to give me more presents? Thank you,
but one is good. Two is too many.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4025]
My, my. A tantalizing thought, but I have already received
a gift from you today.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4026]
Goodness, but you already gave me an offering today.
Feeling overly generous today, are we?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4027]
You gave me gift already. One is good.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4028]
My, my! I couldn't possibly ask for a second gift in such a
short period. But your thoughtfulness is appreciated.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4029]
Aw, shucks! A second present? But you already got me
one today. That's more than enough for me.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4030]
Is that for me? But you already got me a present today
I don't want to be greedy and ask for more.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4031]
Is that for me? But you already got me a present today.
I don't want to be greedy and ask for more.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->

Is that for me? But you already got me a present today.
I don't want to be greedy and ask for more.<wait>

Is that for me? But you already got me a present today.
I don't want to be greedy and ask for more.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4037]
What's the matter, <playername>? What are you
doing with that Preserved Flower?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4038]
Oh, don't tell me you're... M-Maybe we should go
somewhere else.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4039]
You have a Preserved Flower? I wish someone would give
one to me one day.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4040]
What's up? Why're you holding a Preserved Flower and
looking all serious?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4041]
Hold up, you don't mean...?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4042]
Uh, let's go somewhere else. It's a little too...public here.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4043]
Wha?!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4044]
Hold up, that's not for me, is it? You gotta hold onto that
until the time comes to use it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4045]
What is it? Do you need something from me?
Wait, is that a Preserved Flower?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4046]
It seems you have something serious to discuss.
Let's go somewhere else.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4047]
What's the matter? You look so serious.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4048]
Wait, that's...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4049]
I understand. Perhaps we should go somewhere else.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4050]
That's...a Preserved Flower?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4051]
No no, you clearly aren't serious. Hmmm, might I suggest
that you refrain from making such jokes?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4052]
Hey, when you were little, <nickname>, did you look
a lot like <childname>?<wait><page>
I only ask because you two look so similar! Or...maybe
when you're both together, you look even more alike!
...Am I making sense?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4053]
Things are so much brighter with <childname>
around! Why, I'd go so far as to say I feel an extra spring
in my step.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4054]
Now that <childname> is here, I suppose that
makes me a grandma. It's such a strange feeling.
Huh? You're surprised I feel that way?
Regardless of ancestry, I think of you and
<childname> as family. Don't you forget that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4055]
I'm really glad we have <childname>. I feel like it's
helped me realize my purpose in life.<wait><page>
Yeah... I feel like I was born to meet you and
<childname>, <nickname>.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4056]
So, what kind of person d'you think <childname>
will grow up to be? It's kinda fun to imagine.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4057]
I see <childname> is as energetic as always.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4058]
<childname> is ours, after all! As vigorous and
healthy as ever.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4059]
Thank you so much, <nickname>. Words cannot
describe how grateful I am to have you and
<childname> in my life.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4060]
How did <childname> get to be such a mischievous
little thing, anyway? Who did they get that from?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4061]
Oh, <playername>. How is my precious little
grandchild doing? Oh, dear, now I just want to see
them again...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4062]
Dad keeps saying <childname> looks just like us.<wait><page>
I hadn't noticed it myself, but...it is pretty nice to hear.
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4063]
I always thought it would be nice to have a little boy.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4064]
I always thought it would be nice to have a little girl.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4065]
<childname> is so precious, yes? They're
mysteriously beginning to resemble you, by the way,
<nickname>. <wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4066]
Hm? Did *I*? Well, that is a secret. Even to my spouse,
I will not say.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4067]
Hm? What's up? Did you have something you wanted to
talk to me about?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4068]
Well, either way, you're free to stay a while.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4069]
Whoa, really? Haha, I'm so glad to have you as my wife,
<nickname>. ♪<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4070]
Hm? Who might you be giving that to?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4071]
Is that a Blue Feather you've got there? It is a lovely
trinket, but I am not particularly inspired by it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4072]
Huh? Th-Thank you... But, um, you DO know that today's
Valentine's Day, right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4073]
Thanks for always thinking of me on days like these,
<nickname>.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4074]
Thanks... You're always so thoughtful to give me these
sorts of gifts no matter what season it is.<wait>

Thanks... Uh, it's Valentine's Day, though. I-Is it still okay
for me to take this?<wait>

[4076]
Huh? O-Oh, it's Valentine's Day, isn't it? Haha, thanks...<wait>

presents like these from you even after marriage.<wait>

Huh? Today's... Oh, yeah. Thanks.<wait>

Huh? Chocolate? D'you have your festivals mixed up
or something?<wait><page>
Well, you went out of your way to give it to me, so...
I'll take it. Thanks.<wait>

Hm? For me, you say?<wait><page>
Thank you kindly. That is very thoughtful of you.<wait>

Hm? Are you aware of which festival it is today?
Well, I suppose it doesn't matter in the long run...
Thank you.<wait>

Hm? White Day cookies for me?<wait><page>
You are very kind to think of me today! Xie xie.<wait>

[4084]
Why, thank you! I see the occasion matters little to you.
You simply wish to spread joy, yes? I am happy to accept.<wait>

[4085]
Oh, yeah! It's White Day, huh?<wait><page>
It's reassuring to know you're thinking of me, no matter

Haha, you're an awesome wife, you know that?
I'd be happy to accept.<wait>

That's so thoughtful of you! I love a good snack!<wait>

Huh? But usually on White Day, the boys...<wait><page>
Eh, whatever. There's no way I'd turn down a gift from
my cute wife! Thank you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4089]
A Valentine's present for me? Gosh, thanks!<wait><page>
I'm supposed to be the one giving those to you, though...
My bad!<wait>

[4090]
Wooow, thank you! I'd be happy to take it!<wait><page>
Oh, but... I don't really have anything for you in return.
I'm sorry!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4091]
Huh? A Valentine's Day gift?! Thank you!
Hee hee, being married is really nice.<wait><page>
I should've been the one to make you chocolates, though!
I'm sorry...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4092]
Huh? But it's Valentine's Day, silly! Still, I'm sure you
went to a lot of trouble to do this...so I'll take it!
Thank you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4093]
H-Huh? For me...? I'm delighted. Thank you kindly for
thinking of me.<wait>

That looks delectable. Thank you so much...hm?
Today's White Day? Well, that's quite all right.<wait>

Huh? You'd like to give that to me? That's quite generous

O-Oh, but it's Valentine's Day... Is it really all right for me
to take this? You're sure? ...Thank you so much.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4097]
Well, aren't you the sweetest wife! I didn't think you'd
make me cookies, <nickname>. You've brightened
my day... Thank you. ∀<wait>

[4098]
Oh, my! A Valentine's Day gift, for me...? I should have
made one for you first, though... I'm sorry.<wait>

[4099]
Ah, yes! I nearly forgot about Valentine's Day.<wait><page>
Thank you... Shouldn't I be the one giving gifts to you,
though? I appreciate it either way. ∀<wait>

The town's celebrating their Valentine's Day festivities,
aren't they?<wait><page>
...And you'd like to give your chocolates to me?
That's very sweet of you.<wait>

Is this...supposed to be a Valentine's Day present?<wait><page>
I thought I was supposed to give chocolates to you...
Regardless, I'm very grateful. ∀<wait>

Ah, it's Valentine's Day, isn't it?<wait><page>

D'aww, shucks. Getting chocolate from a girl is kind of
embarrassing...<wait><page>
I-I'm not saying it's a bad thing! You're MY girl, after all!<wait>

Good day, <nickname>. Here to shop? <wait><page>
You're shopping for two now, yes? It is quite marvelous to
think about!<wait>

What's this, you say? I am looking more like a father by
the day? I am most happy to hear that.<wait>

[4110]
Welcome, dear <playername>. Is everything all right?<wait>

Ooh, that's a Preserved Flower if I've ever seen one! So?
Who's on the receivin' end of that, <playername>?<wait>

Erm... Th-Thank you.<wait>

Ever since <childname> came into our lives,
Duke and I haven't been fighting as much.
It's like his prickly exterior has all but melted away.
I suppose you aren't at that point in your relationship
yet.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4171]
Huh? Grandpa? Y'know, you're right.
We should invite him too.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4172]
It must be so fun to have someone to come home to.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4173]
Hi, <playername>! How's your better half?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4174]
Hi, <playername>! How's your better half?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4175]
Isn't it nice having someone there to provide support?<wait><page>
When you're by yourself, you end up having to do so much
on your own.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4176]
Oh, <playername>. How are things at home?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4177]
Tell your partner that I'll be dropping by sometime soon.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4178]
Oh, how lovely! They have these flowers for sale now?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4179]
They've got those flowers for sale now? ...Not that I have
any use for 'em.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4180]
Wow, it's that flower we made! I'm super proud of how it
came out!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4181]
It really is a beautiful flower...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4182]
Oh, it's the flower that we made! It's so pretty, I'd never
ever get tired of looking at it!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4183]
Oh, it's the flower from our experiment! It came out
great, if I do say so myself!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4184]
It's our pretty flower! Too bad it doesn't look like it
would make for a good cooking ingredient.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4185]
It's so pretty! I'm glad our experiment was a success.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4186]
It is very pretty, but it doesn't look like it's very filling...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4187]
My, what a lovely flower.
However, I have no need for it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4188]
That flower has been popular of late. I hope your feelings
are conveyed.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4189]
Seeing that you bought one, does that mean you plan to
confess your feelings to someone?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4190]
If it isn't a Preserved Flower. They've been a lovely
addition to our store.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4191]
What's this flower for? You use it to confess your
feelings? Hey, good luck with that.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4192]
Well, ain't that a dandy-looking flower! What's that?
You use it to confess your feelings?<wait><page>
So it's a newfangled tradition, is it? Well, I'm rootin'
for ya!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4193]
That's a Preserved Flower, yes? No matter what form
they take, all flowers are beautiful in their own way.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4194]
My, what a gorgeous flower.
You're going to use it to confess your feelings?
How lovely.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4195]
Oho, a Preserved Flower. Good luck!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4196]
Wow! It's so pretty!
Is it real?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4197]
What's that flower? For confessing?
Well, good luck to you.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4198]
Oh? Well, if it isn't a Preserved Flower.
That's used to confess one's feelings, right?
How wonderful! Receiving such a lovely token of
affection along with words of love would be a dream
come true. But hold on! Are you planning to give that
flower to someone special? I'm rooting for you!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4199]
Oh, well now, look at this lovely specimen. It looks like
it would fetch a fair amount of G. What? You use it to
confess feelings? My, my. Good luck!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4200]
A Preserved Flower? Are you planning to give that to
someone? That's great. If only I'd been able to convey my
own feelings...<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4201]
Oh, who will you confessing your feelings to, pray tell?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4202]
Hrm. Youngsters use these to confess their feelings, eh?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4203]
Very beautiful. 'S nice that you can display it without
worrying about it witherin'.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4204]
Oooh, pretty flower!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4205]
Ah, what a lovely flower.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4206]
Is the farm coming along well?<wait><page>
I have the Clinic to mind, so I cannot help you much, but
tell me if anything is wrong. We're married, after all!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4207]
Hey, <playername>. What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4208]
Hey, <playername>. What's up?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4209]
How's married life? I'm sure it's not all fun, but keep
working at it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4210]
Oh, <playername>. How's married life?
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4211]
I heard you got married. How's that treating you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4212]
Marie's like a never-ending source of good book
recommendations.<wait><page>
You should talk to her if you're ever looking for
a good read.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4213]
I see... You are no doubt busy enough without my meddling,
I'm sure. Don't trouble yourself over it.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4214]
Why, hello there, <playername>. How is married life
treating you?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4215]
I hear a Preserved Flower won't wither even if you don't
care for it. How strange.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4216]
I love flowers, and this one is no exception. It's so pretty!<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4217]
Oh, a Preserved Flower! How do they make these?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4218]
That Preserved Flower is a fine specimen. It has no
pollen, after all. You can bring it into the Clinic without
fear of triggering someone's allergies.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4219]
That's a Preserved Flower, yeah? Hmm, maybe we could
use one to decorate the Inn.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4220]
That's a lovely flower. My dad has one too.
Jeff gave it to him for research purposes.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4221]
A Preserved Flower, I see. As an artist, I admire
its everlasting beauty.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4222]
Oh, how lovely. All of Mother Nature's flowers are unique
and beautiful in their own way.<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4223]
I was just thinking of decorating the Cafe with one of
those. You don't need to worry 'bout taking care of 'em,
right?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
[4224]
That's a Preserved Flower, right? Can any flower be
made into one of those?<wait>
<------------------------------------------------------->
